The following information relates to the credit card receivables owned by the issuing entity and the related credit card accounts. Some of the terms used herein are used as defined in the “Glossary of Defined Terms” at the end of this report.

(1)	
Gross Losses are charge-offs of principal receivables. Gross Losses do not include the amount of any reductions in principal receivables due to fraud, returned goods or customer disputes, the amount of which instead results in the reduction of the Transferor Amount. The number of accounts experiencing a loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was 17,421.

(2)	
Recoveries are amounts received on previously charged-off receivables. As Recoveries are amounts received from defaulted accounts and allocated to the issuing entity from the servicer’s managed portfolio of credit card receivables, the number of accounts with a recovery cannot be calculated. Recoveries as a percentage of Gross Losses for each of the six months ended June 30, 2022 were 28.70% and for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 26.52%, 16.24%, 11.20% and 10.31%.

(3)	
Net Losses are Gross Losses minus Recoveries. Net Losses do not include any reductions in principal receivables due to fraud, returned goods or customer disputes, the amount of which instead results in the reduction of the Transferor Amount. Net Losses as a percentage of Gross Losses for the six months ended June 30, 2022 were 71.30% and for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 73.48%, 83.76%, 88.80% and 89.69%.

(4)	
Annualized.

The delinquency and net loss percentages for the Trust Portfolio at any time reflect, among other factors, the quality of the related credit card loans in the Trust Portfolio, the average seasoning of the related revolving credit card accounts in the Trust Portfolio, the success of JPMorgan Chase Bank’s collection efforts and general economic conditions. Future charge-offs in the Trust Portfolio and overall credit quality for the Trust Portfolio are subject to uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ from current and historical performance.

Revenue Experience

The revenue experience for the issuing entity for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is described in the following table. The revenue experience for the issuing entity in the following table is calculated on a cash basis. Finance charges, fees and interchange are comprised of monthly periodic finance charges, annual membership fees and other credit card fees and interchange amounts.

(1)	
Yield from Finance Charges, Fees and Interchange is the result of dividing finance charges, fees and interchange amounts, by the Average Pool Balance for the periods indicated.

(2)	
Annualized.

The revenue experience will be affected by numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the monthly periodic finance charges on the credit card receivables, other fees and interchange amounts, changes in the delinquency and loss rates on the credit card receivables, the percentage of revolving credit card accounts bearing finance charges at promotional rates and the percentage of cardholders who pay their balances in full each month and do not incur monthly periodic finance charges. These factors may in turn be caused or affected by a variety of other factors, including seasonal spend variations, the availability of other sources of credit and general economic conditions, unemployment levels, consumer spending and borrowing patterns, all of which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, revenue experience will be affected by future changes in the types of charges and fees assessed by JPMorgan Chase Bank on the revolving credit card accounts and on the types of additional revolving credit card accounts added to the issuing entity from time to time.

The revenue experience from periodic finance charges and fees—other than annual fees—depends in part upon the collective preference of cardholders to use their credit cards as revolving debt instruments for purchases and cash advances and to pay account balances over several months—as opposed to convenience use, where cardholders pay off their entire balance each month, thereby avoiding periodic finance charges on their purchases—and upon other credit card related services for which the cardholder pays a fee.

Principal Payment Rates

The cardholder monthly principal payment rate for each month is calculated as a percentage of the Pool Balance as of the first day of that month, subject to adjustment for additions and removals of assets that occur in that month.

Composition of Issuing Entity Receivables.

As of June 30, 2022 (which reflects the reassignment of approximately $1.5 billion of receivables in removed accounts which occurred on July 25, 2022)1:

 

 	•	 	
the Issuing Entity Receivables included $9,328,416,845 in total receivables;

 

 	•	 	
the accounts in the issuing entity had an average total receivables balance of $1,663, including accounts with a zero balance and an average credit limit of $14,910;

 

 	•	 	
the percentage of the aggregate total receivables balance in the Issuing Entity Receivables to the aggregate total credit limit was 11.15%;

 

 	•	 	
the average age of the accounts, the receivables of which are in the Issuing Entity Receivables, was approximately 250 months;

 

 	•	 	
for the June 2022 monthly period, 2.69% of the accounts in the issuing entity received the minimum payment due and 30.20% of the accounts in the issuing entity received a full balance payment; and

 

 	•	 	
of the accounts in the issuing entity, approximately 12.05% related to cardholders with billing addresses in California, 8.64% in New York, 7.93% in Texas, 6.39% in Florida and 5.88% in Illinois; no other single state accounts for more than 5% of the accounts in the issuing entity. Since the largest number of accountholders (based on billing addresses) whose accounts were included in the issuing entity were in California, New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois, adverse economic, financial or social conditions, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, or environmental conditions affecting accountholders residing in these states could affect timely payment by the related accountholders of amounts due on the accounts and, accordingly, the actual rates of delinquencies and losses with respect to the issuing entity.

The following tables summarize the Issuing Entity Receivables by various criteria as of June 30, 2022 (which reflects the reassignment of approximately $1.5 billion of receivables in removed accounts which occurred on July 25, 2022). Receivables in the following tables include principal, finance charge and fee receivables held directly by the issuing entity. Because the composition of the Issuing Entity Receivables may change over time, these tables are not necessarily indicative of the composition of the receivables in the issuing entity at any future time. In addition, in each of the following tables the number of accounts includes all non-charged off credit card accounts in the Trust Portfolio, but does not include inactivated credit card accounts where the credit card had been lost or stolen or that had been flagged for potential fraud and replaced with a new credit card account.

FICO® Scores

The following table reflects the distribution of the FICO scores for a statistically significant random sample of credit card accounts included in the Trust Portfolio received by JPMorgan Chase Bank in June 2022 and the outstanding receivables balances of the related accounts as of June 30, 2022. Because the composition of the Trust Portfolio is expected to change over time, there can be no assurance that the FICO score distribution for the Trust Portfolio in future periods will be similar to the information set forth below. In addition, FICO scores may change over time, depending on the conduct of the cardholder and changes in credit score technology.
