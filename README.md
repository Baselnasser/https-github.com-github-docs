Hello and welcome back to the command line. This is a doozy of a release, so strap in.

Precompiled extensions
We've made a significant change to gh's extension system. Now, extension authors can work in a precompiled language like Go and ship pre-compiled binaries of their extensions via release assets.

For a full tour of this new support, check out our demo video.

We've added scaffolding and helpers to make it a first class experience when working in Go, though of course any compiled binaries will work just fine as long as they are uploaded to a release with the expected naming scheme.

To assist with releasing precompiled extensions (Go or otherwise), we've created an action that helps automates the building and release process.

To get started, run gh extension create.

Extensions create ðŸ’… by @mislav in #4802
go-gh
We've open sourced a small Go library called go-gh. Its goal is to make it easer for extension authors to take advantage of some gh features directly in Go code. Check out the repository to learn more or watch the precompiled extension demo.

New repo create interface
The gh repo create command now has distinct usages for creating a repository from scratch and creating one from a local git repository.

Create a new repository on GitHub from scratch and clone it locally with

$ gh repo create myrepo --public --clone
Upload an existing local repository with

$ gh repo create myrepo --source=path/to/repo --public
Breaking Changes:

gh repo create will not behave differently inside a local git repository.
gh repo create will only prompt interactively when run with no arguments. Otherwise, all arguments should be passed explicitly.
For more information, see gh help repo create
