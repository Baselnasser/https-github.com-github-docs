See [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to get started with our project. 

We accept different [types of contributions](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/types-of-contributions.md), including some that don't require you to write a single line of code.

On the GitHub Docs site, you can click the make a contribution button at the bottom of the page to open a pull request for quick fixes like typos, updates, or link fixes.

If you're looking for a way to contribute, you can scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) for something to work on. When ready, check out [Getting Started with Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions.
