## Sorting by field values

{% endnote %}

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}

   ![Screenshot showing the sort menu item](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/sort-menu-item.png)

   ![Screenshot showing "no sorting"](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/no-sorting.png)

Alternatively, open the project command palette by pressing {% data variables.projects.command-palette-shortcut %} and start typing "Sort by."

## Grouping by field values in table layout

In the table layout, you can group items by a custom field value. When items are grouped, if you drag an item to a new group, the value of that group is applied. For example, if you group by "Status" and then drag an item with a status of `In progress` to the `Done` group, the status of the item will switch to `Done`. Similarly, when you add a new item to a group, the new item is populated with the value of the group.

{% note %}

**Note:** You cannot group by title, labels, reviewers, or linked pull requests.

{% endnote %}

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click {% octicon "rows" aria-label="the rows icon" %} **Group**.
   ![Screenshot showing the group menu item](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/group-menu-item.png)
1. Click the field you want to group by.
   ![Screenshot showing the group menu](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/group-menu.png)
2. Optionally, to disable grouping, click {% octicon "x" aria-label="the x icon" %} **No grouping** at the bottom of the list.
   ![Screenshot showing "no grouping"](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/no-grouping.png)

Alternatively, open the project command palette by pressing {% data variables.projects.command-palette-shortcut %} and start typing "Group by."

{% ifversion projects-v2-numeric-summary %}

## Showing the sum of a number field

You can configure a view to show the sum of one of more number fields, including a count of items in the group or column. For example, if you have a number field tracking the number of hours each item may take to complete, you can display of sum of those hours for each group or column.

In board layout, field sums are displayed at the top of each column. In table layout, when you enable grouping by a field, field sums are included in each group's header.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click {% octicon "number" aria-label="the number icon" %} **Field sum**.
   
   ![Screenshot showing the field sum menu item](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/field-sum-menu.png)
   
1. Select the fields you want to include.

{% endif %}

## Setting the column field in board layout

In the board layout, you choose any single select or iteration field for your columns. If you drag an item to a new column, the value of that column is applied to the dragged item. For example, if you use the "Status" field for your board columns and then drag an item with a status of `In progress` to the `Done` column, the status of the item will switch to `Done`.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click {% octicon "columns" aria-label="the columns icon" %} **Column field**.
