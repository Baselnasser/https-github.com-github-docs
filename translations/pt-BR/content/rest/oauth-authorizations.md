You can use this API to manage the access OAuth applications have to your account. You can only access this API via [Basic Authentication](/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication) using your username and password, not tokens.

If you or your users have two-factor authentication enabled, make sure you understand how to [work with two-factor authentication](/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication).
