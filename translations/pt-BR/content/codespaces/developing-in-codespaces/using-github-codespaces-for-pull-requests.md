## About pull requests in {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} provides you with many of the capabilities you might need to work with pull requests:

- [Create a pull request](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-source-control-in-your-codespace#raising-a-pull-request) - Using either the Terminal and Git commands or the Source Control view, you can create pull requests just as you would on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. If the repository uses a pull request template, you'll be able to use this within the Source Control view.
- [Open a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request-in-codespaces) â€“ You can open an existing pull request in a codespace, provided you have codespace access to the branch that is being merged in.
- [Review a pull request](#reviewing-a-pull-request-in-codespaces) - Once you have opened a pull request in a codespace, you can use the "GitHub Pull Request" view to add review comments and approve pull requests. You can also use {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} to [view review comments](#view-comments-from-a-review-in-codespaces).
