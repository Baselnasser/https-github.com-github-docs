### Community conversations in {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}

Since {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} is an open forum, there is an opportunity to bring non-code collaboration into a project's repository and gather diverse feedback and ideas more quickly. You can help drive a productive conversation by:

- Asking pointed questions and follow-up questions to garner specific feedback
- Capture a diverse experience and distill it down to main points
- Open an issue to take action based on the conversation, where applicable

For more information about opening an issue and cross-referencing a discussion, see "[Opening an issue from a comment](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/opening-an-issue-from-a-comment)."

### Learning about conversations on GitHub

You can create and participate in discussions, issues, and pull requests, depending on the type of conversation you'd like to have.

You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} to discuss big picture ideas, brainstorm, and spike out a project's specific details before committing it to an issue, which can then be scoped. Discussions are useful for teams if:
- You are in the discovery phase of a project and are still learning which director your team wants to go in
- You want to collect feedback from a wider community about a project
- You want to keep bug fixes, feature requests, and general conversations separate

Os problemas são úteis para discutir detalhes específicos de um projeto, como relatórios de erros e melhorias planejadas. Para obter mais informações, consulte "[Sobre problemas](/articles/about-issues)". As pull requests permitem comentar diretamente nas alterações propostas. Para obter mais informações, consulte "[Sobre pull requests](/articles/about-pull-requests)" e "[Comentar em uma pull request](/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request)".
