          De modo geral, o cache do repositório está disponível. O cache do repositório aumenta o desempenho de leitura do Git para desenvolvedores distribuídos, fornecendo a localidade e a conveniência de dados de georreplicação sem impacto em fluxos de trabalho de push. Com a versão de disponibilidade geral, o GitHub Enterprise Server armazena em cache os dados do Git e Git LFS. Para obter mais informações, consulte "[Sobre cache de repositórios](/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositóries/about-repository-caching)."

        - |
          On instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license, secret scanning prevents the leak of secrets in the web editor. For more information, see "[Protecting pushes with secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning#using-secret-scanning-as-a-push-protection-from-the-web-ui)."
        - |
          Enterprise owners and users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can view secret scanning alerts and bypasses of secret scanning's push protection in the enterprise and organization audit logs, and via the REST API. For more information, see the following documentation.

          - "[Protecting pushes with secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning)"

        - |
          Enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can perform dry runs of custom secret scanning patterns for the enterprise, and all users can perform dry runs when editing a pattern. Dry runs allow you to understand a pattern's impact across the entire instance and hone the pattern before publication and generation of alerts. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
        - |
          Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can use `sort` and `direction` parameters in the REST API when retrieving secret scanning alerts, and sort based on the alert’s `created` or `updated` fields. The new parameters are available for the entire instance, or for individual organizations or repositories. For more information, see the following documentation.

      heading: Dependabot
      notes:
        - |
          Enterprise owners on instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license can see an overview of Dependabot alerts for the entire instance, including a repository-centric view of application security risks, and an alert-centric view of all secret scanning and Dependabot alerts. The views are in beta and subject to change, and alert-centric views for code scanning are planned for a future release of GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Viewing the security overview](/code-security/security-overview/viewing-the-security-overview#viewing-the-security-overview-for-an-enterprise)."
        - |
          Users can select multiple Dependabot alerts, then dismiss or reopen or dismiss the alerts. For example, from the **Closed alerts** tab, you can select multiple alerts that have been previously dismissed, and then reopen them all at once. For more information, see "[About Dependabot alerts](/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)."
        - |
          Dependabot updates `@types` dependencies alongside corresponding packages in TypeScript projects. Before this change, users would see separate pull requests for a package and the corresponding `@types` package. This feature is automatically enabled for repositories containing `@types` packages in the project's `devDependencies` within the _package.json_ file. You can disable this behavior by setting the [`ignore`](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#ignore) field in your `dependabot.yml` file to `@types/*`. For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)" and "[Configuration options for the _dependabot.yml_ file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file)."

          GitHub Actions can enforce dependency reviews on users' pull requests by scanning for dependencies, and will warn users about associated security vulnerabilities. The `dependency-review-action` action is supported by a new API endpoint that diffs the dependencies between any two revisions. For more information, see "[About dependency review](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review#dependency-review-enforcement)."
        - |
          The dependency graph detects _Cargo.toml_ and _Cargo.lock_ files for Rust. These files will be displayed in the **Dependency graph** section of the **Insights** tab. Users will receive Dependabot alerts and updates for vulnerabilities associated with their Rust dependencies. Package metadata, including mapping packages to repositories, will be added at a later date. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."

      heading: GitHub Actions
      notes:
        - |
          Within a workflow that calls a reusable workflow, users can pass the secrets to the reusable workflow with `secrets: inherit`. For more information, see "[Reusing workflows](/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#using-inputs-and-secrets-in-a-reusable-workflow)."
        - |
          When using GitHub Actions, to reduce the risk of merging a change that was not reviewed by another person into a protected branch, enterprise owners and repository administrators can prevent Actions from creating pull requests. Organization owners could previously enable this restriction. For more information, see the following articles.

          - "[Enforcing policies for GitHub Actions in your enterprise](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)"

        - |
          Users can write a single workflow triggered by `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call`, and use the `inputs` context to access input values. Previously, `workflow_dispatch` inputs were in the event payload, which increased difficulty for workflow authors who wanted to write one workflow that was both reusable and manually triggered. For workflows triggered by `workflow_dispatch`, inputs are still available in the `github.event.inputs` context to maintain compatibility.  For more information, see "[Contexts](/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#inputs-context)."
        - |
          To summarize the result of a job, users can generate Markdown and publish the contents as a job summary. For example, after running tests with GitHub Actions, a summary can provide an overview of passed, failed, or skipped tests, potentially reducing the need to review the full log output. For more information, see "[Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary)."
        - |
          To more easily diagnose job execution failures during a workflow re-run, users can enable debug logging, which outputs information about a job's execution and environment. For more information, see "[Re-running workflows and jobs](/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs)" and "[Using workflow run logs](/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs#viewing-logs-to-diagnose-failures)."
        - |
          If you manage self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions, you can ensure a consistent state on the runner itself before and after a workflow run by defining scripts to execute. By using scripts, you no longer need to require that users manually incorporate these steps into workflows. Pre- and post-job scripts are in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Running scripts before or after a job](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/running-scripts-before-or-after-a-job)."

      heading: GitHub Package Registry
      notes:
        - |
          Enterprise owners can migrate container images from the GitHub Docker registry to the GitHub Container registry. The Container registry provides the following benefits.

          - Improves the sharing of containers within an organization
          - Allows the application of granular access permissions
          - Permits the anonymous sharing of public container images
          - Implements OCI standards for hosting Docker images

          The Container registry is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Migrating your enterprise to the Container registry from the Docker registry](/admin/packages/migrating-your-enterprise-to-the-container-registry-from-the-docker-registry)."

          While creating a fork, users can customize the fork's name. For more information, see "[Fork a repo](/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)."
        - |
          Users can block creation of branches that match a configured name pattern with the **Restrict pushes that create matching branches** branch protection rule. For example, if a repository's default branch changes from `master` to `main`, a repository administrator can prevent any subsequent creation or push of the `master` branch. For more information, see
          "[About protected branches](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#restrict-who-can-push-to-matching-branches)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule)."
        - |
          Users can create a branch directly from a repository's **Branches** page by clicking the **New branch**. For more information, see "[Creating and deleting branches within your repository](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)."
        - |
          Users can delete a branch that's associated with an open pull request. For more information, see "[Creating and deleting branches within your repository](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)."
        - |
          Repositories with multiple licenses display all of the licenses in the "About" sidebar on the {% octicon "code" aria-label="The code icon" %} **Code** tab. For more information, see "[Licensing a repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)."
        - When a user renames or moves a file to a new directory, if at least half of the file's contents are identical, the commit history indicates that the file was renamed, similar to `git log --follow`. For more information, see the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-06-view-commit-history-across-file-renames-and-moves/).
        - |
          Users can require a successful deployment of a branch before anyone can merge the pull request associated with the branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-deployments-to-succeed-before-merging)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)."

      heading: Commits
      notes:
        - |
          For public GPG signing keys that are expired or revoked, GitHub Enterprise Server verifies Git commit signatures and show commits as verified if the user made the commit while the key was still valid. Users can also upload expired or revoked GPG keys. For more information, see "[About commit signature verification](/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)."
        - |
          To affirm that a commit complies with the rules and licensing governing a repository, organization owners and repository administrators can now require developers to sign off on commits made through the web interface. For more information, see "[Managing the commit signoff policy for your organization](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-organization)" and "[Managing the commit signoff policy for your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-repository)."
    - 
      heading: Pull requests
      notes:
        - |
          Using the file tree located in the **Files changed** tab of a pull request, users can navigate modified files, understand the size and scope of changes, and focus reviews. The file tree appears if a pull request modifies at least two files, and the browser window is sufficiently wide. For more information, see "[Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)" and "[Filtering files in a pull request](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/filtering-files-in-a-pull-request)."
        - |
          Users can default to using pull requests titles as the commit message for all squash merges. For more information, see "[Configuring commit squashing for pull requests](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests)."

      heading: markdown
      notes:
        - |
          Editing Markdown in the web interface has been improved.

          - After a user selects text and pastes a URL, the selected text will become a Markdown link to the pasted URL.
          - When a user pastes spreadsheet cells or HTML tables, the resulting text will render as a table.
          - When a user copies text containing links, the pasted text will include the link as a Markdown link.

          For more information, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)."
        - |
          When editing a Markdown file in the web interface, clicking the **Preview** tab will automatically scroll to the place in the preview that you were editing. The scroll location is based on the position of your cursor before you clicked the **Preview** tab.
  changes:
    - Interactive elements in the web interface such as links and buttons show a visible outline when focused with a keyboard, to help users find the current position on a page. In addition, when focused, form fields have a higher contrast outline.
    - If a user refreshes the page while creating a new issue or pull request, the assignees, reviewers, labels and projects will all be preserved.
  known_issues:
    - Em uma instância de {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} recém-configurada sem usuários, um invasor pode criar o primeiro usuário administrador.
    - As regras de firewall personalizadas são removidas durante o processo de atualização.
    - Arquivos LFS do Git [enviados através da interface web](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) são adicionados diretamente ao repositório e de forma incorreta.
    - Os problemas não podem ser fechados se contiverem um permalink para um blob no mesmo repositório, onde o caminho do arquivo blob's é maior que 255 caracteres.
    - Quando "Usuários podem pesquisar pelo GitHub.com" está habilitado com o GitHub Connect, os problemas em repositórios privados e internos não estão incluídos nos resultados de pesquisa do GitHub.com.
    - O registro npm de {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} não retorna mais o valor de tempo em respostas de metadados. Isso foi feito para permitir melhorias substanciais de desempenho. Continuamos a ter todos os dados necessários para devolver um valor de tempo como parte da resposta aos metadados e retomaremos o retorno desse valor no futuro, assim que tivermos resolvido os problemas de desempenho existentes.
    - Os limites de recursos que são específicos para processamento de hooks pre-receive podem causar falha em alguns hooks pre-receive.
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
    - Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
