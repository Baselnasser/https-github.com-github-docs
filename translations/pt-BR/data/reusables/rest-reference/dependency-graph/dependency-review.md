## Revisão de dependência

{% data reusables.dependency-review.dependency-review-api-beta-note %}

The Dependency Review API allows you to understand dependency changes, and the security impact of these changes, before you add them to your environment. You can view the diff of dependencies between two commits of a repository, including vulnerability data for any version updates with known vulnerabilities. Para obter mais informações sobre a análise de dependências, consulte "[Sobre a revisão de dependências](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review)".
