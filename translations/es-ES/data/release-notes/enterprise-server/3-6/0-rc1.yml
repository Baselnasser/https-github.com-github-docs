        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2256
        - |
          Enterprise owners on instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license can see an overview of Dependabot alerts for the entire instance, including a repository-centric view of application security risks, and an alert-centric view of all secret scanning and Dependabot alerts. The views are in beta and subject to change, and alert-centric views for code scanning are planned for a future release of GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Viewing the security overview](/code-security/security-overview/viewing-the-security-overview#viewing-the-security-overview-for-an-enterprise)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1993
        - |
          Dependabot alerts show users if repository code calls vulnerable functions. Individual alerts display a "vulnerable call" label and code snippet, and users can filter search by `has:vulnerable-calls`. Vulnerable functions are curated during publication to the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories). New incoming Python advisories will be supported, and GitHub is backfilling known vulnerable functions for historical Python advisories. After beta testing with Python, GitHub will add support for other ecosystems. For more information, see "[Viewing and updating Dependabot alerts](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/viewing-and-updating-dependabot-alerts)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2160
        - |
          Users can select multiple Dependabot alerts, then dismiss or reopen or dismiss the alerts. For example, from the **Closed alerts** tab, you can select multiple alerts that have been previously dismissed, and then reopen them all at once. For more information, see "[About Dependabot alerts](/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2232
        - |
          Dependabot updates `@types` dependencies alongside corresponding packages in TypeScript projects. Before this change, users would see separate pull requests for a package and the corresponding `@types` package. This feature is automatically enabled for repositories containing `@types` packages in the project's `devDependencies` within the _package.json_ file. You can disable this behavior by setting the [`ignore`](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#ignore) field in your `dependabot.yml` file to `@types/*`. For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)" and "[Configuration options for the _dependabot.yml_ file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file)."

          GitHub Actions can enforce dependency reviews on users' pull requests by scanning for dependencies, and will warn users about associated security vulnerabilities. The `dependency-review-action` action is supported by a new API endpoint that diffs the dependencies between any two revisions. For more information, see "[About dependency review](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review#dependency-review-enforcement)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2243
        - |
          The dependency graph detects _Cargo.toml_ and _Cargo.lock_ files for Rust. These files will be displayed in the **Dependency graph** section of the **Insights** tab. Users will receive Dependabot alerts and updates for vulnerabilities associated with their Rust dependencies. Package metadata, including mapping packages to repositories, will be added at a later date. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."

          When using GitHub Actions, to reduce the risk of merging a change that was not reviewed by another person into a protected branch, enterprise owners and repository administrators can prevent Actions from creating pull requests. Organization owners could previously enable this restriction. For more information, see the following articles.

          - "[Enforcing policies for GitHub Actions in your enterprise](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)"

          Users can write a single workflow triggered by `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call`, and use the `inputs` context to access input values. Previously, `workflow_dispatch` inputs were in the event payload, which increased difficulty for workflow authors who wanted to write one workflow that was both reusable and manually triggered. For workflows triggered by `workflow_dispatch`, inputs are still available in the `github.event.inputs` context to maintain compatibility.  For more information, see "[Contexts](/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#inputs-context)."

          To summarize the result of a job, users can generate Markdown and publish the contents as a job summary. For example, after running tests with GitHub Actions, a summary can provide an overview of passed, failed, or skipped tests, potentially reducing the need to review the full log output. For more information, see "[Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2161

          If you manage self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions, you can ensure a consistent state on the runner itself before and after a workflow run by defining scripts to execute. By using scripts, you no longer need to require that users manually incorporate these steps into workflows. Pre- and post-job scripts are in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Running scripts before or after a job](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/running-scripts-before-or-after-a-job)."

          Editing Markdown in the web interface has been improved.
          
          - After a user selects text and pastes a URL, the selected text will become a Markdown link to the pasted URL.
          - When a user pastes spreadsheet cells or HTML tables, the resulting text will render as a table.
          - When a user copies text containing links, the pasted text will include the link as a Markdown link.

          For more information, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)."

          When editing a Markdown file in the web interface, clicking the **Preview** tab will automatically scroll to the place in the preview that you were editing. The scroll location is based on the position of your cursor before you clicked the **Preview** tab.

  changes:
    - Interactive elements in the web interface such as links and buttons show a visible outline when focused with a keyboard, to help users find the current position on a page. In addition, when focused, form fields have a higher contrast outline.
    - If a user refreshes the page while creating a new issue or pull request, the assignees, reviewers, labels and projects will all be preserved.

  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
    - Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
