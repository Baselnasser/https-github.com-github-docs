1. The first time that you use Git to clone a repository or access data in a repository that you've already cloned, Git will request credentials. Provide the PAT for the account with access to the repository.

   Git will cache the PAT for the directory you're in, and you'll be able to access and write repository data on {% data variables.product.product_location %} using the correct account.
