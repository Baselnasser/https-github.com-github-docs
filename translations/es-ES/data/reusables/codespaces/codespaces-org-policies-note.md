**Note**: Codespace policies only apply to codespaces for which your organization will be billed. If an individual user creates a codespace for a repository in your organization, and the organization is not billed, then the codespace will not be bound by these policies. For information on how to choose who can create codespaces that are billed to your organization, see "[Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} for your organization](/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/enabling-github-codespaces-for-your-organization#choose-who-can-create-codespaces-that-are-billed-to-your-organization)."
