Checks data older than 400 days is archived. As part of the archiving process {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} creates a rollup commit status representing the state of all of the checks for that commit. As a consequence, the merge box in any pull request with archived checks that are required will be in a blocked state and you will need to rerun the checks before you can merge the pull request.
