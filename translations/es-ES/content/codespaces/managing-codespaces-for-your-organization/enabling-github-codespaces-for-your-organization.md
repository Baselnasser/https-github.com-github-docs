## About enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} for your organization

Organization owners can control which users in your organization can create and use codespaces at the organization's expense. For information about pricing, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)."

Only people who can either push changes to a repository, or fork the repository, can create a codespace for that repository. To allow people to create codespaces for repositories owned by your organization, you must:

- Ensure that users have at least write access to the repositories where they want to use a codespace. For more information, see "[Managing teams and people with access to your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository)."
- Ensure that your organization does not have an IP address allow list enabled. For more information, see "[Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/{% ifversion fpt %}enterprise-cloud@latest/{% endif %}organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization){% ifversion fpt %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% else %}."{% endif %}

To allow people to create codespaces for which your organization will be billed, you must:

- [Set a spending limit](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/managing-spending-limits-for-codespaces)
- [Choose who can create codespaces that are billed to your organization](#choose-who-can-create-codespaces-that-are-billed-to-your-organization)

{% ifversion fpt %}
{% note %}

**Note:** If you are a verified educator or a teacher, you must enable {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} from a {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} to use your {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} Education benefit. For more information, see "[Using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/using-github-codespaces-with-github-classroom#about-the-codespaces-education-benefit-for-verified-teachers)."

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

By default, a codespace can only access the repository from which it was created. If you want codespaces in your organization to be able to access other organization repositories that the codespace creator can access, see "[Managing repository access for your organization's codespaces](/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-repository-access-for-your-organizations-codespaces)."

## Choose who can create codespaces that are billed to your organization

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.click-codespaces %}
1. Under "Billing," select one of the following options:

   * **Disabled** - Your organization will not be charged for codespace usage. {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} created for your organization's repositories will be billed to the individual users who create them.
   * **Selected members** - {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} created for your organization's repositories by selected members will be billed to the organization.
   * **All members** - {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} created for your organization's repositories by members of your organization will be billed to the organization.
   * **All members and outside collaborators** - {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} created for your organization's repositories by organization members and outside collaborators will be billed to the organization.

   **Note:** When you select **All members and outside collaborators**,  all outside collaborators who have been added to specific repositories can create and use {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} for those repositories, and your organization will be billed for this usage. For more information on managing outside collaborators, see "[About outside collaborators](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization#about-outside-collaborators)."

   {% endnote %}
