## About unexpected license usage

If the number of consumed licenses for your enterprise is unexpected, you can review your consumed license report to audit your license usage across all your enterprise deployments and subscriptions. If you find errors, you can try troubleshooting steps. For more information about viewing your license usage, see "[Viewing license usage for GitHub Enterprise](/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/viewing-license-usage-for-github-enterprise)" and "[Viewing the subscription and usage for your enterprise account](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/viewing-the-subscription-and-usage-for-your-enterprise-account)."

For privacy reasons, enterprise owners cannot directly access the details of user accounts.

## About the calculation of consumed licenses

{% data variables.product.company_short %} bills for each person who uses deployments of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, is a member of an organization on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, or is a {% data variables.product.prodname_vs_subscriber %}. For more information about the people in your enterprise who are counted as consuming a license, see "[About per-user pricing](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/about-per-user-pricing)."

## Fields in the consumed license files

The {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} license usage report and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} exported license usage file include a variety of fields to help you troubleshoot license usage for your enterprise.
### {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} license usage report (CSV file)

The license usage report for your enterprise is a CSV file that contains the following information about members of your enterprise. Some fields are specific to your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} (GHEC) deployment, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} (GHES) connected environments, or your {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} subscriptions (VSS) with GitHub Enterprise.

## Troubleshooting consumed licenses

If the number of consumed seats is unexpected, or if you've recently removed members from your enterprise, we recommend that you audit your license usage.

To determine which users are currently consuming seat licenses, first try reviewing the consumed licenses report for your enterprise{% ifversion ghes %} and/or an export of your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} license usage{% endif %} for unexpected entries.

There are two especially common reasons for inaccurate or incorrect license seat counts.
- The email addresses associated with a user do not match across your enterprise deployments and subscriptions.
- An email address for a user was recently updated or verified to correct a mismatch, but a license sync job hasn't run since the update was made.

When attempting to match users across enterprises, {% data variables.product.company_short %} identifies individuals by the verified email addresses associated with their {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} account, and the primary email address associated with their {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} account and/or the email address assigned to the {% data variables.product.prodname_vs_subscriber %}.

Your license usage is recalculated shortly after each license sync is performed. You can view the timestamp of the last license sync job, and, if a job hasn't run since an email address was updated or verified, to resolve an issue with your consumed license report you can manually trigger one. For more information, see "[Syncing license usage between GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud](/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/syncing-license-usage-between-github-enterprise-server-and-github-enterprise-cloud)."

{% ifversion ghec or ghes > 3.1 %}
If your enterprise uses verified domains, review the list of enterprise members who do not have an email address from a verified domain associated with their {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} account. Often, these are the users who erroneously consume more than one licensed seat. Para obtener más información, consulta la sección "[Ver a los miembros sin un a dirección de correo electrónico desde un dominio verificado](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/viewing-people-in-your-enterprise#viewing-members-without-an-email-address-from-a-verified-domain)".
{% endif %}

{% note %}

**Note:** For privacy reasons, your consumed license report only includes the email address associated with a user account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} if the address is hosted by a verified domain. For this reason, we recommend using verified domains with your enterprise account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. Then, if one person is erroneously consuming multiple licenses, you can more easily troubleshoot, as you will have access to the email address that is being used for license deduplication.

{% endnote %}

{% ifversion ghec %}

If your license includes {% data variables.product.prodname_vss_ghe %} and your enterprise also includes at least one {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} connected environment, we strongly recommend using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} to automatically synchronize your license usage. For more information, see "[About Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise](/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-licenses-for-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise/about-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise)."

If you still have questions about your consumed licenses after reviewing the troubleshooting information above, you can contact {% data variables.contact.github_support %} through the {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_portal %}.
