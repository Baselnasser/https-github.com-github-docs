## About repository submissions

Only public repositories owned by personal accounts can be submitted to {% data variables.product.prodname_community_exchange %}.

There are three types of repository submissions:

- **Learn.** A repository to share step-by-step instructions to build a project.
- **Collaborate.** A repository seeking collaborators to work on a project.
- **Learn and Collaborate.** A repository which is a combination of `Learn` and `Collaborate`.

Consider what the main purpose of your repository is when choosing the type of submission for your repository.

To promote your project and make it more discoverable to other students, you should assign one or more topics and {% data variables.product.prodname_student_pack %} offers to your repository. Para obtener más información, consulta "[Clasificar tu repositorio con temas](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)".

Once a repository has been submitted to {% data variables.product.prodname_community_exchange %}, it will be published immediately with the purpose, topics, and offers you've chosen. La comunidad de {% data variables.product.prodname_community_exchange %} modera todas las emisiones de los repositorios.

### Submission requirements

Your repository must meet a minimum set of requirements for a submission to be accepted. During the submission process, if the submission criteria hasn't been met for your selected repository, you will be notified of the missing items.

For a submission with a purpose of `Learn`, your repository must have:
- A description.
- A LEARN.md file to provide step-by-step instructions, with text and/or media, on how you built your project. Ideally, your LEARN.md file will deconstruct your project into small components and provide thorough details of each step, so that other students can code their project by following your instructions.
- A README.md file to provide a detailed description of your project.

For a submission with a purpose of `Collaborate`, your repository must have:
- Una descripción.
- Un archivo de README.md para proporcionar la descripción detallada de tu proyecto.
- One or more issues for collaborators to work on.

A good repository submission for both `Learn` and `Collaborate` purposes, is a repository that follows community standards.
