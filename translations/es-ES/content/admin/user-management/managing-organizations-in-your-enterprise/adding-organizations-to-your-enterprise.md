## About addition of organizations to your enterprise account

Your enterprise account can own organizations. Members of your enterprise can collaborate across related projects within an organization. For more information, see "[About organizations](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)."

You can add new organizations to your enterprise account. If you do not use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you can add existing organizations on {% data variables.product.product_location %} to your enterprise. You cannot add an existing organization from an {% data variables.product.prodname_emu_enterprise %} to a different enterprise.

{% data reusables.enterprise.create-an-enterprise-account %} For more information, see "[Creating an enterprise account](/admin/overview/creating-an-enterprise-account)."

After you add an existing organization to your enterprise, the organization's resources remain accessible to members at the same URLs, and the following changes will apply.

- The organization's members will become members of the enterprise, and {% data variables.product.company_short %} will bill the enterprise account for the organization's usage. You must ensure that the enterprise account has enough licenses to accommodate any new members. For more information, see "[About billing for your enterprise](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-github-account/about-billing-for-your-enterprise)."
- Enterprise owners can manage their role within the organization. For more information, see "[Managing your role in an organization owned by your enterprise](/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/managing-your-role-in-an-organization-owned-by-your-enterprise)."
- Any policies applied to the enterprise will apply to the organization. For more information, see "[About enterprise policies](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/about-enterprise-policies)."
- If SAML SSO is configured for the enterprise account, the enterprise's SAML configuration will apply to the organization. If the organization used SAML SSO, the enterprise account's configuration will replace the organization's configuration. SCIM is not available for enterprise accounts, so SCIM will be disabled for the organization. For more information, see "[Configuring SAML single sign-on for your enterprise](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise)" and "[Switching your SAML configuration from an organization to an enterprise account](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/switching-your-saml-configuration-from-an-organization-to-an-enterprise-account)."
- If SAML SSO was configured for the organization, members' existing personal access tokens (PATs) or SSH keys that were authorized to access the organization's resources will be authorized to access the same resources. To access additional organizations owned by the enterprise, members must authorize the PAT or key. For more information, see "[Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on](/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on)" and "[Authorizing an SSH key for use with SAML single sign-on](/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-an-ssh-key-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on)."
- If the organization was connected to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, adding the organization to an enterprise will not update the connection. {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} features will no longer function for the organization. To continue using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, you must disable and re-enable the feature. For more information, see the following articles.

  - "[Managing {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}](/enterprise-server@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/managing-github-connect)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} documentation
  - "[Managing {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}](/github-ae@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/managing-github-connect)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} documentation
- If the organization used billed {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} apps, the organization can continue to use the apps, but must pay the vendor directly. For more information, contact the app's vendor.

## Creating an organization in your enterprise account

New organizations you create within your enterprise account settings are included in your enterprise account's {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} subscription.

Enterprise owners who create an organization owned by the enterprise account automatically become organization owners. For more information about organization owners, see "[Roles in an organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."

## Inviting an organization to join your enterprise account

Enterprise owners can invite existing organizations to join their enterprise account. If the organization you want to invite is already owned by another enterprise, you will not be able to issue an invitation until the previous enterprise gives up ownership of the organization. For more information, see "[Removing an organization from your enterprise](/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/removing-organizations-from-your-enterprise)."
