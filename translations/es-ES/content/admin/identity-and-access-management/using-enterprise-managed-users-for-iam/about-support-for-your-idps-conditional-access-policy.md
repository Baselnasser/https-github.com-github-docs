## About support for Conditional Access Policies

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.emu-cap-validates %}

CAP support is enabled automatically for any {% data variables.product.prodname_emu_enterprise %} that enables OIDC SSO and cannot be disabled. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} enforces your IdP's IP conditions but not device compliance conditions.

For more information about using OIDC with {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, see "[Configuring OIDC for Enterprise Managed Users](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/configuring-oidc-for-enterprise-managed-users)" and "[Migrating from SAML to OIDC](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/migrating-from-saml-to-oidc)."

## About using CAP with IP allow lists

We recommend disabling your enterprise account's IP allow list and relying on your IdP's CAP. If you enable IP allow lists for your enterprise and also make use of your IdP's CAP, both the IP allow list and CAP will be enforced. If either restriction rejects a user's IP address, the request fails. For more information about IP allow lists, see "[Enforcing policies for security settings in your enterprise](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise#managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise)."

## Considerations for integrations and automations

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} sends the originating IP address to your IdP for validation against your CAP. To make sure  actions and apps are not blocked by your IdP's CAP, you will need to make changes to your configuration.

### {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

Actions that use a personal access token will likely be blocked by your IdP's CAP. We recommend that personal access tokens are created by a service account which is then exempted from IP controls in your IdP's CAP.

If you're unable to use a service account, another option for unblocking actions that use personal access tokens is to allow the IP ranges used by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

### {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}

When {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %} make requests on a member's behalf, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will send the IP address of the app's server to your IdP for validation. If the IP address of the app's server is not validated by your IdP's CAP, the request will fail.

You can contact the owners of the apps you want to use, ask for their IP ranges, and configure your IdP's CAP to allow access from those IP ranges. If you're unable to contact the owners, you can review your IdP sign-in logs to review the IP addresses seen in the requests, then allow-list those addresses.

You can also enable IP allow list configuration for installed {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}. When enabled, all {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %} will continue working regardless of the originating IP address.
