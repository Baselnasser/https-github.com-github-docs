## About privately reporting a security vulnerability

Security researchers often feel responsible for alerting users to a vulnerability that could be exploited. If there are no clear instuctions about contacting maintainers of the repository containing the vulnerability, security researchers may have no other choice but to post about the vulnerability on social media, send direct messages to the maintainer, or even create public issues. This situation can potentially lead to a public disclosure of the vulnerability details.

For maintainers, the benefits of using private vulnerability reporting are: 
- Less risk of being contacted publicly, or via undesired means.
- Receive reports in the same platform you resolve them in for simplicity
- The security researcher creates or at least initiates the advisory report on the behalf of maintainers.
- Maintainers receive reports in the same platform as the one used to discuss and resolve the advisories.
- Vulnerability less likely to be in the public eye.
- The opportunity to discuss vulnerability details privately with security researchers and collaborate on the patch.

## Enabling or disabling private vulnerability reporting for a repository

When a maintainer enables private security reporting for their repository, security researchers will see a new button in the **Advisories** page of the repository. The security researcher can click this button to privately report a security vulnerability to the repository maintainer.
