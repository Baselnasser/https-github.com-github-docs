This article is part of a series on adopting {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} at scale. For the previous article in this series, see "[Phase 1: Align on your rollout strategy and goals](/code-security/adopting-github-advanced-security-at-scale/phase-1-align-on-your-rollout-strategy-and-goals)."

## Preparing to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}
 
{% data reusables.code-scanning.about-code-scanning %} For more information, see "[About code scanning](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning)."

Rolling {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} out across hundreds of repositories can be difficult, especially when done inefficiently. Following these steps will ensure your rollout is both efficient and successful. As part of your preparation, you will work with your teams, use automation to collect data about your repositories, and enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. 

### Preparing teams for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}

First, prepare your teams to use {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. The more teams that use {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}, the more data you'll have to drive remediation plans and monitor progress on your rollout. During this phase, focus on leveraging APIs and running internal enablement events.

Your core focus should be preparing as many teams to use {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} as possible. You can also encourage teams to remediate appropriately, but we recommend prioritizing enablement and use of {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} over fixing issues during this phase.
  
### Collecting information about your repositories

You can programmatically gather information about the different programming languages used in your repositories and use that data to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} on all repositories that use the same language, using {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s GraphQL API.

{% note %}

**Note:** To gather this data without manually running the GraphQL queries described in this article, you can use our publicly available tool. For more information, see the "[ghas-enablement tool](https://github.com/NickLiffen/ghas-enablement)" repository.

{% endnote %}

If you want to gather information from repositories belonging to multiple organizations in your enterprise, you can use the query below to obtain the names of your organizations and then feed those into repository query. Replace OCTO-ENTERPRISE with your enterprise name.

```graphql
query {
  enterprise(slug: "OCTO-ENTERPRISE") {
    organizations(first: 100) {
      totalCount
      nodes {
        name
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can identify which repositories use which languages by collating repositories by language at the organization level. You can modify the sample GraphQL query below, replacing OCTO-ORG with the organization name.

```graphql
query {
  organization(login: "OCTO-ORG") { 
    repositories(first: 100) {
      totalCount
      nodes {
        nameWithOwner
        languages(first: 100) {
          totalCount
          nodes {
            name
          }
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For more information about running GraphQL queries, see "[Forming calls with GraphQL](/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql)."

Then, convert the data from the GraphQL query into a readable format, such as a table.

| Language                | Number of Repos | Name of Repos                           |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| JavaScript (TypeScript) | 4212            | org/repo<br /> org/repo |
| Python                  | 2012            | org/repo<br /> org/repo |
| Go                      | 983             | org/repo<br /> org/repo |
| Java                    | 412             | org/repo<br /> org/repo |
| Swift                   | 111             | org/repo<br /> org/repo |
| Kotlin                  | 82              | org/repo<br /> org/repo |
| C                       | 12              | org/repo<br /> org/repo |

You can filter out the languages that are currently not supported by {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} from this table.

If you have repositories with multiple languages, you can format the GraphQL results as shown in the table below. Filter out languages that are not supported, but retain all repositories with at least one supported language. You can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} on these repositories, and all supported languages will be scanned.

| Language(s)            | Number of Repos | Name of Repos                            |
|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| JavaScript/Python/Go   | 16              | org/repo <br /> org/repo |
| Rust/TypeScript/Python | 12              | org/repo <br /> org/repo |

An understanding of which repositories are using which languages will help you identify candidate repositories for pilot programs in phase 3, and prepares you to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} across all repositories, one language at a time, in phase 5.

### Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for your appliance

Before you can proceed with pilot programs and rolling out {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} across your enterprise, you must first enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for your appliance. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning for your appliance](/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance)."

{% endif %}

## Preparing to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}

If a project communicates with an external service, it might use a token or private key for authentication. If you check a secret into a repository, anyone who has read access to the repository can use the secret to access the external service with your privileges. {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} will scan your entire Git history on all branches present in your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repositories for secrets and alert you{% ifversion secret-scanning-push-protection %} or block the push containing the secret{% endif %}. For more information, see "[About secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning)."

### Considerations when enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}

{% data variables.product.product_name %}â€™s {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} capability is slightly different from {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} since it requires no specific configuration per programming language or per repository and less configuration overall to get started. This means enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} at the organizational level can be easy but clicking **Enable All** at the organization level and ticking the option **Automatically enable {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} for every new repository** has some downstream effects that you should be aware of:

- **License consumption**  
  Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} for all repositories will consume all your licenses, even if no one is using code scanning. This is fine unless you plan to increase the number of active developers in your organization. If the number of active developers is likely to increase in the coming months, you may exceed your license limit and then be unable to use {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} on newly created repositories.
- **Initial high volume of detected secrets**  
  If you are enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} on a large organization, be prepared to see a high number of secrets found. Sometimes this comes as a shock to organizations and the alarm is raised. If you would like to turn on {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} across all repositories at once, plan for how you will respond to multiple alerts across the organization.

{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} can be enabled for individual repositories. For more information, see "[Configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} for your repositories](/code-security/secret-scanning/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-repositories)." {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} can also be enabled for all repositories in your organization, as described above. For more information on enabling for all repositories, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization)."

### Custom patterns for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}

{% ifversion ghae %}
{% note %}

**Note:** Custom patterns for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} is currently in beta and is subject to change.

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} detects a large number of default patterns but can also be configured to detect custom patterns, such as secret formats unique to your infrastructure or used by integrators that {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} does not currently detect. For more information about supported secrets for partner patterns, see "[Secret scanning patterns](/code-security/secret-scanning/secret-scanning-patterns)." 

As you audit your repositories and speak to security and developer teams, build a list of the secret types that you will later use to configure custom patterns for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
