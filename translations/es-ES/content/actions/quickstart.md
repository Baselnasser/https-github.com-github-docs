## Introduction

You only need a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository to create and run a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. 

The following example shows you how {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

## Creating your first workflow

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in  your repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} if this directory does not already exist.
1. In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `github-actions-demo.yml`. For more information, see "[Creating new files](/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/creating-new-files)."
1. Copy the following YAML contents into the `github-actions-demo.yml` file:

   ```yaml{:copy}
   name: GitHub Actions Demo
   {%- ifversion actions-run-name %}
   run-name: {% raw %}${{ github.actor }}{% endraw %} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
   {%- endif %}
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     Explore-GitHub-Actions:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a {% raw %}${{ github.event_name }}{% endraw %} event."
         - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a {% raw %}${{ runner.os }}{% endraw %} server hosted by GitHub!"
         - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {% raw %}${{ github.ref }}{% endraw %} and your repository is {% raw %}${{ github.repository }}{% endraw %}."
         - name: Check out repository code
           uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
         - run: echo "üí° The {% raw %}${{ github.repository }}{% endraw %} repository has been cloned to the runner."
         - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
         - name: List files in the repository
           run: |
             ls {% raw %}${{ github.workspace }}{% endraw %}
         - run: echo "üçè This job's status is {% raw %}${{ job.status }}{% endraw %}."
   ```
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. Then, to create a pull request, click **Propose new file**.

Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the `push` event and runs your workflow.

## Viewing your workflow results

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
1. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

   ![Workflow list in left sidebar](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-workflow-sidebar.png)
1. From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

   ![Name of workflow run](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-run-name.png)
1. Under **Jobs** , click the **Explore-GitHub-Actions** job.

   ![Locate job](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-job.png)
1. The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

   ![Example workflow results](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-logs.png)
   
   For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:

The example workflow you just added is triggered each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} can work with the contents of your repository. For an in-depth tutorial, see "[Understanding {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)."
