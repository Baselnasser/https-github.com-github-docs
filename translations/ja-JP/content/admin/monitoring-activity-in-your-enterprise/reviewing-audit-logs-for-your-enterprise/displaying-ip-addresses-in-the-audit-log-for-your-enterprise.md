## About display of IP addresses in the audit log

By default, {% data variables.product.product_name %} does not display the source IP address for events in your enterprise's audit log. Optionally, to ensure compliance and respond to threats, you can display the full IP address associated with the actor responsible for each event. Actors are typically users, but can also be apps or integrations.

You are responsible for meeting any legal obligations that accompany the viewing or storage of IP addresses displayed within your enterprise's audit log.

If you choose to display IP addresses, the IP addresses only appear in your enterprise's audit log. IP addresses will not appear for events in the audit logs for individual organizations owned by your enterprise. For more information about organization audit logs, see "[Reviewing the audit log for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization)."

You can display IP addresses in the audit log regardless of which authentication method you use for your enterprise on {% data variables.product.product_location %}. 詳しい情報については「[Enterpriseでの認証について](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/about-authentication-for-your-enterprise)」を参照してください。

When anyone creates an account on {% data variables.product.product_location %}, the person agrees to {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s collection of basic information about connections to {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s services, including source IP address.

## Events that display IP addresses in the audit log

{% data variables.product.product_name %} displays an IP address in the audit log when a member of the enterprise interacts with a resource owned by your enterprise or an organization in your enterprise. For example, you will see an IP address for audited events involving an internal or private repository owned by an organization in your enterprise, or resources associated with those repositories, such as an issue, pull request, action, or project.

If members of your enterprise access {% data variables.product.product_location %} with personal accounts that they manage, because you do not use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, {% data variables.product.product_name %} does not display an event or IP address in the audit log for the following actions.

- Authentication to {% data variables.product.product_location %}
- Interactions with a resource owned by the personal account, including a repository, gist, or project
- Interactions with a public repository owned by an organization in your enterprise
