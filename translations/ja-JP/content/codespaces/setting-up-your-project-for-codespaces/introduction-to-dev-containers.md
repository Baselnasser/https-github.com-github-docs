## 開発コンテナについて

Development containers, or dev containers, are Docker containers that are specifically configured to provide a full-featured development environment. Whenever you work in a codespace, you are using a dev container on a virtual machine.

You can configure the dev container for a repository so that codespaces created for that repository give you a tailored development environment, complete with all the tools and runtimes you need to work on a specific project. If you don't define a configuration in the repository then {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} uses a default configuration, which contains many of the common tools that your team might need for development with your project. For more information, see "[Using the default dev container configuration](#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration)."

The configuration files for a dev container are contained in a `.devcontainer` directory in your repository. You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} to add configuration files for you. You can choose from a selection of predefined configurations for various project types. You can use these without further configuration, or you can edit the configurations to refine the development environment they produce. For more information, see "[Using a predefined dev container configuration](#using-a-predefined-dev-container-configuration)."

Alternatively, you can add your own custom configuration files. For more information, see "[Creating a custom dev container configuration](#creating-a-custom-dev-container-configuration)."

You can define a single dev container configuration for a repository, different configurations for different branches, or multiple configurations. When multiple configurations are available, users can choose their preferred configuration when they create a codespace. This is particularly useful for large repositories that contain source code in different programming languages or for different projects. You can create a choice of configurations that allow different teams to work in a codespace that's set up appropriately for the work they are doing.

### devcontainer.json

The primary file in a dev container configuration is the `devcontainer.json` file. You can use this file to determine the environment of codespaces created for your repository. The contents of this file define a dev container that can include frameworks, tools, extensions, and port forwarding. The `devcontainer.json` file usually contains a reference to a Dockerfile, which is typically located alongside the `devcontainer.json` file.

If you don't add a `devcontainer.json` file to your repository. the default dev container configuration is used. For more information, see "[Using the default dev container configuration](#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration)."

The `devcontainer.json` file is usually located in the `.devcontainer` directory of your repository. Alternatively, you can locate it directly in the root of the repository, in which case the file name must begin with a period: `.devcontainer.json`.

If you want to have a choice of dev container configurations in your repository, any alternatives to the  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (or `.devcontainer.json`) file must be located in their own subdirectory at the path `.devcontainer/SUBDIRECTORY/devcontainer.json`. For example, you could have a choice of two configurations:
* `.devcontainer/database-dev/devcontainer.json`
* `.devcontainer/gui-dev/devcontainer.json`

When you have multiple `devcontainer.json` files in your repository, each codespace is created from only one of the configurations. Settings cannot be imported or inherited between `devcontainer.json` files. If a `devcontainer.json` file in a custom subdirectory has dependent files, such as the Dockerfile or scripts that are run by commands in the `devcontainer.json` file, it's recommended that you co-locate these files in the same subdirectory.

For information about how to choose your preferred dev container configuration when you create a codespace, see "[Creating a codespace](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace)."

{% data reusables.codespaces.more-info-devcontainer %}

#### How to use the devcontainer.json

It's useful to think of the `devcontainer.json` file as providing "customization" rather than "personalization." You should only include things that everyone working on your codebase needs as standard elements of the development environment, not things that are personal preferences. Things like linters are good to standardize on, and to require everyone to have installed, so they're good to include in your `devcontainer.json` file. Things like user interface decorators or themes are personal choices that should not be put in the `devcontainer.json` file.

You can personalize your codespaces by using dotfiles and Settings Sync. For more information, see "[Personalizing Codespaces for your account](/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account)."

### Dockerfile

You can add a Dockerfile as part of your dev container configuration.

The Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions needed to create a Docker container image. This image is used to generate a development container each time someone creates a codespace using the `devcontainer.json` file that references this Dockerfile. The instructions in the Dockerfile typically begin by referencing a parent image on which the new image that will be created is based. This is followed by commands that are run during the image creation process, for example to install software packages.

The Dockerfile for a dev container is typically located in the `.devcontainer` folder, alongside the `devcontainer.json` in which it is referenced.

{% note %}

**Note**: As an alternative to using a Dockerfile you can use the `image` property in the `devcontainer.json` file to refer directly to an existing image you want to use. If neither a Dockerfile nor an image is found then the default container image is used. For more information, see "[Using the default dev container configuration](#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration)."

{% endnote %}

#### Simple Dockerfile example

The following example uses four instructions:

`ARG` defines a build-time variable.

`FROM` specifies the parent image on which the generated Docker image will be based.

`COPY` copies a file and adds it to the filesystem.

`RUN` updates package lists and runs a script. You can also use a `RUN` instruction to install software, as shown by the commented out instructions. To run multiple commands, use `&&` to combine the commands into a single `RUN` statement.

```Dockerfile{:copy}
ARG VARIANT="16-buster"
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-${VARIANT}

# [Optional] Uncomment if you want to install an additional version of node using nvm
# ARG EXTRA_NODE_VERSION=10
# RUN su node -c "source /usr/local/share/nvm/nvm.sh && nvm install ${EXTRA_NODE_VERSION}"

# [Optional] Uncomment if you want to install more global node modules
# RUN su node -c "npm install -g <your-package-list-here>"

COPY library-scripts/github-debian.sh /tmp/library-scripts/
RUN apt-get update && bash /tmp/library-scripts/github-debian.sh
```

For more information about Dockerfile instructions, see "[Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder)" in the Docker documentation.

#### Using a Dockerfile

To use a Dockerfile as part of a dev container configuration, reference it in your `devcontainer.json` file by using the `dockerfile` property.

```json{:copy}
{
  ...
  "build": { "dockerfile": "Dockerfile" },
  ...
}
```

For more information about using a Dockerfile in a dev container configuration, see the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} documentation "[Create a development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container#_dockerfile)."

## Using the default dev container configuration

If you don't define a configuration in your repository, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} creates a codespace using a default Linux image. This Linux image includes a number of runtime versions for popular languages like Python, Node, PHP, Java, Go, C++, Ruby, and .NET Core/C#. The latest or LTS releases of these languages are used. There are also tools to support data science and machine learning, such as JupyterLab and Conda. The image also includes other developer tools and utilities like Git, GitHub CLI, yarn, openssh, and vim. To see all the languages, runtimes, and tools that are included use the `devcontainer-info content-url` command inside your codespace terminal and follow the URL that the command outputs.

Alternatively, for more information about everything that's included in the default Linux image, see the latest file in the [`microsoft/vscode-dev-containers`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/codespaces-linux) repository.

The default configuration is a good option if you're working on a small project that uses the languages and tools that {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} provides.

## Using a predefined dev container configuration

You can choose from a list of predefined configurations to create a dev container configuration for your repository. These configurations provide common setups for particular project types, and can help you quickly get started with a configuration that already has the appropriate container options, {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} settings, and {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} extensions that should be installed.

追加の拡張性が必要な場合は、事前定義済みの設定を使用することをお勧めします。 You can also start with a predefined configuration and amend it as needed for your project.

You can add a predefined dev container configuration either while working in a codespace, or while working on a repository locally.

{% data reusables.codespaces.command-palette-container %}
1. Click the definition you want to use.

   ![List of predefined container definitions](/assets/images/help/codespaces/predefined-container-definitions-list.png)

1. Follow the prompts to customize your definition. For more information on the options to customize your definition, see "[Adding additional features to your `devcontainer.json` file](#adding-additional-features-to-your-devcontainerjson-file)."
1. [**OK**] をクリックします。

   ![OK button](/assets/images/help/codespaces/prebuilt-container-ok-button.png)

1. If you are working in a codespace, apply your changes, by clicking **Rebuild now** in the message at the bottom right of the window. For more information about rebuilding your container, see "[Applying changes to your configuration](#applying-configuration-changes-to-a-codespace)."

   !["Codespaces: Rebuild Container" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_command_palette %}](/assets/images/help/codespaces/rebuild-prompt.png)

### Adding additional features to your `devcontainer.json` file

{% note %}

**Note:** This feature is in beta and subject to change.

{% endnote %}

You can add features to your predefined container configuration to customize which tools are available and extend the functionality of your workspace without having to create a custom dev container configuration from scratch. For example, you could use a predefined container configuration and add the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. You can make these additional features available for your project by adding the features to your `devcontainer.json` file when you set up your container configuration.

You can add some of the most common features by selecting them when configuring your predefined container. For more information on the available features, see the [script library](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/script-library#scripts) in the `vscode-dev-containers` repository.


1. Access the Command Palette (`Shift + Command + P` / `Ctrl + Shift + P`), then start typing "configure". Select **Codespaces: Configure Devcontainer Features**.

   ![The Configure Devcontainer Features command in the command palette](/assets/images/help/codespaces/codespaces-configure-features.png)

1. Update your feature selections, then click **OK**.

   ![The select additional features menu during container configuration](/assets/images/help/codespaces/select-additional-features.png)

1. To apply the changes, in the bottom right corner of the screen, click **Rebuild now**. For more information about rebuilding your container, see "[Applying changes to your configuration](#applying-configuration-changes-to-a-codespace)."

   !["Codespaces: Rebuild Container" in the command palette](/assets/images/help/codespaces/rebuild-prompt.png)

## Creating a custom dev container configuration

If none of the predefined configurations meets your needs, you can create a custom configuration by writing your own `devcontainer.json` file.

* If you're adding a single `devcontainer.json` file that will be used by everyone who creates a codespace from your repository, create the file within a `.devcontainer` directory at the root of the repository.
* If you want to offer users a choice of configuration, you can create multiple custom `devcontainer.json` files, each located within a separate subdirectory of the `.devcontainer` directory.

   {% note %}

   **Note**: You can't locate your `devcontainer.json` files in directories more than one level below `.devcontainer`. For example, a file at `.devcontainer/teamA/devcontainer.json` will work, but `.devcontainer/teamA/testing/devcontainer.json` will not.

   {% endnote %}

   If multiple `devcontainer.json` files are found in the repository, they are listed in the codespace creation options page. 詳しい情報については、「[codespace を作成する](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace)」を参照してください。

   ![A choice of configuration files](/assets/images/help/codespaces/configuration-file-choice.png)

### Default configuration selection during codespace creation

If `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json` exists, it will be the default selection in the list of available configuration files when you create a codespace. If neither file exists, the default dev container configuration will be selected by default.

![The default configuration choice selected](/assets/images/help/codespaces/configuration-file-choice-default.png)

### Editing the devcontainer.json file

You can add and edit the supported configuration keys in the `devcontainer.json` file to specify aspects of the codespace's environment, like which {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} extensions will be installed. {% data reusables.codespaces.more-info-devcontainer %}

The `devcontainer.json` file is written using the JSONC format. This allows you to include comments within the configuration file. For more information, see "[Editing JSON with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} documentation.

{% note %}

**Note**: If you use a linter to validate the `devcontainer.json` file, make sure it is set to JSONC and not JSON or comments will be reported as errors.

{% endnote %}

### Editor settings for Visual Studio Code

{% data reusables.codespaces.vscode-settings-order %}

2 つの場所で {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} のデフォルトのエディタ設定を定義できます。

* Editor settings defined in the `.vscode/settings.json` file in your repository are applied as _Workspace_-scoped settings in the codespace.
* Editor settings defined in the `settings` key in the `devcontainer.json` file are applied as _Remote [Codespaces]_-scoped settings in the codespace.

## Applying configuration changes to a codespace

{% data reusables.codespaces.apply-devcontainer-changes %}

{% data reusables.codespaces.rebuild-command %}
1. {% data reusables.codespaces.recovery-mode %} Fix the errors in the configuration.

   ![Error message about recovery mode](/assets/images/help/codespaces/recovery-mode-error-message.png)

   - To diagnose the error by reviewing the creation logs, click **View creation log**.
   - To fix the errors identified in the logs, update your `devcontainer.json` file.
   - To apply the changes, rebuild your container.
