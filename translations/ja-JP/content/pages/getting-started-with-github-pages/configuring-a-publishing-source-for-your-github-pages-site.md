## About publishing sources

{% data reusables.pages.pages-about-publishing-source %}

{% data reusables.pages.private_pages_are_public_warning %}

## Publishing from a branch

1. Make sure the branch you want to use as your publishing source already exists in your repository.
{% data reusables.pages.navigate-site-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.pages.sidebar-pages %}
{% ifversion pages-custom-workflow %}
1. Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
1. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", use the **None** or **Branch** drop-down menu and select a publishing source.

{% else %}
3. Under "{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}", use the **None** or **Branch** drop-down menu and select a publishing source.

{% endif %}
4. Optionally, use the drop-down menu to select a folder for your publishing source.

5. Click **Save**.

### Troubleshooting publishing from a branch

{% data reusables.pages.admin-must-push %}

If you choose the `docs` folder on any branch as your publishing source, then later remove the `/docs` folder from that branch in your repository, your site won't build and you'll get a page build error message for a missing `/docs` folder. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting Jekyll build errors for {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites](/articles/troubleshooting-jekyll-build-errors-for-github-pages-sites#missing-docs-folder)."

{% ifversion build-pages-with-actions %}

Your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site will always be deployed with a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow run, even if you've configured your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site to be built using a different CI tool. Most external CI workflows "deploy" to GitHub Pages by committing the build output to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository, and typically include a `.nojekyll` file. When this happens, the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow will detect the state that the branch does not need a build step, and will execute only the steps necessary to deploy the site to {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} servers.

To find potential errors with either the build or deployment, you can check the workflow run for your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site by reviewing your repository's workflow runs. For more information, see "[Viewing workflow run history](/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/viewing-workflow-run-history)." For more information about how to re-run the workflow in case of an error, see "[Re-running workflows and jobs](/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs)."

## Publishing with a custom {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow

{% data reusables.pages.pages-custom-workflow-beta %}

To configure your site to publish with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}:

{% data reusables.pages.navigate-site-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.pages.sidebar-pages %}
1. Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**.
1. {% data variables.product.product_name %} will suggest several starter workflows. If you already have a workflow to publish your site, you can skip this step. Otherwise, choose one of the options to create a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow. For more information about creating your custom workflow, see "[Creating a custom {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow to publish your site](#creating-a-custom-github-actions-workflow-to-publish-your-site)."

   {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} does not associate a specific workflow to the {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} settings. However, the {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} settings will link to the workflow run that most recently deployed your site.

### Creating a custom {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow to publish your site

For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see "[Actions](/actions)."

When you configure your site to publish with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will suggest starter workflows for common publishing scenarios. The general flow of a workflow is to:

1. Trigger whenever there is a push to the default branch of the repository or whenever a pull request that targets the default branch is opened, reopened, or updated.
1. Use the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action to check out the repository contents.
1. If required by your site, build any static site files.
1. Use the [`actions/upload-pages-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact) action to upload the static files as an artifact.
1. If the workflow was triggered by a push to the default branch, use the [`actions/deploy-pages`](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) action to deploy the artifact. This step is skipped if the workflow was triggered by a pull request.

The starter workflows use a deployment environment called `github-pages`. If your repository does not already include an environment called `github-pages`, the environment will be created automatically. We recommend that you add an environment protection rule so that only the default branch can deploy to this environment. For more information, see "[Using environments for deployment](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)."

{% note %}

**Note**: A `CNAME` file in your repository file does not automatically add or remove a custom domain. Instead, you must configure the custom domain through your repository settings or through the API. For more information, see "[Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain)" and the [Pages API reference documentation](/rest/pages#update-information-about-a-github-pages-site).
