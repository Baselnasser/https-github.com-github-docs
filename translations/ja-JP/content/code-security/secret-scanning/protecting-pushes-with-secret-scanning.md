## About push protection for secrets

Up to now, {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_GHAS %} checks for secrets _after_ a push and alerts users to exposed secrets. {% data reusables.secret-scanning.push-protection-overview %}

If a contributor bypasses a push protection block for a secret, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}:
- generates an alert.
- creates an alert in the "Security" tab of the repository.
- adds the bypass event to the audit log.{% ifversion secret-scanning-push-protection-email %}
- sends an email alert to organization owners, security managers, and repository administrators, with a link to the related secret and the reason why it was allowed.{% endif %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} as a push protection currently scans repositories for secrets issued by the following service providers.

{% data reusables.secret-scanning.secret-list-private-push-protection %}

## Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} as a push protection

For you to use {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} as a push protection, the organization or repository needs to have both {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} enabled. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization)," "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)," and "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}](/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security)."

Organization owners, security managers, and repository administrators can enable push protection for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} via the UI and API. For more information, see "[Repositories](/rest/reference/repos#update-a-repository)" and expand the "Properties of the `security_and_analysis` object" section in the REST API documentation.

## Using {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} as a push protection from the command line

When you attempt to push a supported secret to a repository or organization with {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} as a push protection enabled, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will block the push. You can remove the secret from your commit or follow a provided URL to allow the push.

Up to five detected secrets will be displayed at a time on the command line. If a particular secret has already been detected in the repository and an alert already exists, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will not block that secret. 

![Screenshot showing that a push is blocked when a user attempts to push a secret to a repository](/assets/images/help/repository/secret-scanning-push-protection-with-link.png)

If you need to remove the secret from your latest commit (that is, `HEAD`) on the branch being pushed and any earlier commits that contain the secret, you can remove the secret from `HEAD`, then squash the commits between when the commit was introduced and the first version of `HEAD` for which the secret has been removed.

{% note %}

**Notes**: 

* If your git configuration supports pushes to multiple branches, and not only to the default branch, your push may be blocked due to additional and unintended refs being pushed. For more information, see the [`push.default` options](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-pushdefault) in the Git Docs.
* If {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} upon a push times out, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will still run a scan after the push.

{% endnote %}

### Allowing a blocked secret to be pushed

If {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} blocks a secret that you believe is safe to push, you can allow the secret and specify the reason why it should be allowed.

If you confirm a secret is real and that you intend to fix it later, you should aim to remediate the secret as soon as possible. For example, you might revoke the secret and remove the secret from the repository's commit history. For more information, see "[Removing sensitive data from a repository](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)."

{% data reusables.secret-scanning.push-protection-allow-secrets-alerts %}

{% data reusables.secret-scanning.push-protection-allow-email %}

1. Visit the URL returned by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} when your push was blocked.
  ![Screenshot showing form with options for unblocking the push of a secret](/assets/images/help/repository/secret-scanning-unblock-form.png)
{% data reusables.secret-scanning.push-protection-choose-allow-secret-options %}
1. Click **Allow me to push this secret**.
2. Reattempt the push on the command line within three hours. If you have not pushed within three hours, you will need to repeat this process.

## Using secret scanning as a push protection from the web UI

When you use the web UI to attempt to commit a supported secret to a repository or organization with secret scanning as a push protection enabled, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will block the commit. You will see a banner at the top of the page with information about the secret's location, and the secret will also be underlined in the file so you can easily find it.  

  ![Screenshot showing commit in web ui blocked because of secret scanning push protection](/assets/images/help/repository/secret-scanning-push-protection-web-ui-commit-blocked-banner.png)

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will only display one detected secret at a time in the web UI. If a particular secret has already been detected in the repository and an alert already exists, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will not block that secret.

You can remove the secret from the file using the web UI. Once you remove the secret, the banner at the top of the page will change and tell you that you can now commit your changes.

### Bypassing push protection for a secret

If {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} blocks a secret that you believe is safe to push, you can allow the secret and specify the reason why it should be allowed. If you confirm a secret is real and that you intend to fix it later, you should aim to remediate the secret as soon as possible.
