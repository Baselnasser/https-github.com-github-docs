For these three languages, {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analyzes the source files in your repository that are built. {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} also runs a build for Go projects to set up the project, but then analyzes _all_ Go files in the repository, not just the files that are built. For any of these languages, including Go, you can disable `autobuild` and instead use custom build commands in order to analyze only the files that are built by these custom commands.
