Always include a security admonition above this procedure. This is either one of the following, depending on whether the context is self-hosted runners or larger runners.

All organizations have a single default runner group. Organizations within an enterprise account can create additional groups. Organization admins can allow individual repositories access to a runner group. For information about how to create a runner group with the REST API, see "[Self-hosted runner groups](/rest/reference/actions#self-hosted-runner-groups)."

Runners are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can move a runner from the default group to any group you create.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which repositories{% ifversion restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} have access to the runner group.

1. Enter a name for your runner group, and assign a policy for repository access.

   You can configure a runner group to be accessible to a specific list of repositories, or to all repositories in the organization.{% ifversion ghec or ghes %} By default, only private repositories can access runners in a runner group, but you can override this. This setting can't be overridden if configuring an organization's runner group that was shared by an enterprise.{% endif %}

1. Click **Save group** to create the group and apply the policy.
