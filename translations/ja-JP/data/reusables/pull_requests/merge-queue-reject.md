After grouping a pull request with the latest version of the target branch and changes ahead of it in the queue, if there are failed required status checks or conflicts with the base branch, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will remove the pull request from the queue. The pull request timeline will display the reason why the pull request was removed from the queue.
