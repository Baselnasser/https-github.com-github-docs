To enforce the IP allow list, you must first add IP addresses to the list, then enable the IP allow list.{% ifversion ip-allow-list-address-check %} After you complete your list, you can check whether a particular IP address would be allowed by any of the enabled entries in the list.{% endif %} 

You must add your current IP address, or a matching range, before you enable the IP allow list.
