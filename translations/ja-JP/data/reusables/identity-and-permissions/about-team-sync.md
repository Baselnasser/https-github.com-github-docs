If team sync is enabled for your organization or enterprise account, you can synchronize a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} team with an IdP group. When you synchronize a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} team with an IdP group, membership changes to the IdP group are reflected on {% data variables.product.product_name %} automatically, reducing the need for manual updates and custom scripts. {% ifversion ghec %}For more information, see "[Managing team synchronization for your organization](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/managing-team-synchronization-for-your-organization)" and "[Managing team synchronization for organizations in your enterprise](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/managing-team-synchronization-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise)".{% endif %}
