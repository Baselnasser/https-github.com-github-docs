If you want to allow authentication for some people who don't have an account on your external authentication provider, you can allow fallback authentication to local accounts on {% data variables.product.product_location %}. For more information, see "[Allowing built-in authentication for users outside your provider](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/allowing-built-in-authentication-for-users-outside-your-provider)."
