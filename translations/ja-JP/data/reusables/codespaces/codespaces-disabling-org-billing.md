{% note %}

**Note**:  If you disable billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} for some organization members and collaborators, or for your entire organization, anyone who can either push changes to, or fork, a repository in your organization, will still be able to create a codespace for that repository by using their personal account. However, this will not incur any charge for your organization. For information about restricting access to a repository, see "[Managing teams and people with access to your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository)."
