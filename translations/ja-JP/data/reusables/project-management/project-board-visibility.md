By default, user-owned and organization-wide project boards are private and only visible to people with read, write, or admin permissions to the project board. {% ifversion ghae %}An internal{% else %}A public{% endif %} project board is visible to {% ifversion ghae %}anyone with access to your enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %}{% elsif ghes %}anyone with access to your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance{% else %}anyone with the project board's URL{% endif %}. Repository-level project boards share the visibility of their repository. That is, a private repository will have a private board, and this visibility cannot be changed.
