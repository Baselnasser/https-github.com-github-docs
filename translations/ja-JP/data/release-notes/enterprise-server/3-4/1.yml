      When using SAML encrypted assertions with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4.0 and 3.4.1, a new XML attribute `WantAssertionsEncrypted` in the `SPSSODescriptor` contains an invalid attribute for SAML metadata. IdPs that consume this SAML metadata endpoint may encounter errors when validating the SAML metadata XML schema. A fix will be available in the next patch release. [Updated: 2022-04-11]

      To work around this problem, you can take one of the two following actions.
      - Reconfigure the IdP by uploading a static copy of the SAML metadata without the `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute.
      - Copy the SAML metadata, remove `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute, host it on a web server, and reconfigure the IdP to point to that URL.

      notes:
        - '**{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0 was discontinued on February 16, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.'

This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date.

      heading: Deprecation of the Content Attachments API preview
      notes:
        - Due to low usage, we have deprecated the Content References API preview in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. The API was previously accessible with the `corsair-preview` header. Users can continue to navigate to external URLs without this API. Any registered usages of the Content References API will no longer receive a webhook notification for URLs from your registered domain(s) and we no longer return valid response codes for attempted updates to existing content attachments.
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of the Codes of Conduct API preview
      notes:
        - 'The Codes of Conduct API preview, which was accessible with the `scarlet-witch-preview` header, is deprecated and no longer accessible in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. We instead recommend using the "[Get community profile metrics](/rest/reference/repos#get-community-profile-metrics)" endpoint to retrieve information about a repository''s code of conduct. For more information, see the "[Deprecation Notice: Codes of Conduct API preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-06-deprecation-notice-codes-of-conduct-api-preview/)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog.'

      heading: Deprecation of OAuth Application API endpoints and API authentication using query parameters
      notes:
        - |
          Starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, the [deprecated version of the OAuth Application API endpoints](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/#endpoints-affected) have been removed. If you encounter 404 error messages on these endpoints, convert your code to the versions of the OAuth Application API that do not have `access_tokens` in the URL. We've also disabled the use of API authentication using query parameters. We instead recommend using [API authentication in the request header](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/#changes-to-make).

      heading: Deprecation of the CodeQL runner
      notes:
        - The {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} runner is deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4 and is no longer supported. The deprecation only affects users who use {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} code scanning in third party CI/CD systems; {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} users are not affected. We strongly recommend that customers migrate to the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} runner. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-21-codeql-runner-deprecation/).
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of custom bit-cache extensions
      notes:
        - |
          Starting in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1, support for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s proprietary bit-cache extensions began to be phased out. These extensions are deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 onwards.

          Any repositories that were already present and active on {% data variables.product.product_location %} running version 3.1 or 3.2 will have been automatically updated.

          Repositories which were not present and active before upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 may not perform optimally until a repository maintenance task is run and has successfully completed.

          To start a repository maintenance task manually, browse to `https://<hostname>/stafftools/repositories/<owner>/<repository>/network` for each affected repository and click the Schedule button.
  backups:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.4.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).'
