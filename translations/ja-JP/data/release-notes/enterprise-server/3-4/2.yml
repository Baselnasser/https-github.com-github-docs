  security_fixes:
    - パッケージは最新のセキュリティバージョンにアップデートされました。
  bugs:
    - Resolved a regression that could lead to consistent failures to retrieve artifacts and download log archives for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. In some circumstances we stopped resolving URLs for internal communications that used `localhost`, and instead incorrectly used the instance hostname.
    - When a manifest file was deleted from a repository, the manifest would not be removed from the repository's "Dependency graph" page.
    - Upgrading the nodes in a high availability pair with an upgrade package could cause Elasticsearch to enter an inconsistent state in some cases.
    - Rotated log files with the extension `.backup` would accumulate in directories containing system logs.
    - In some cluster topologies, the command line utilities `ghe-spokesctl` and `ghe-btop` failed to run.
    - Elasticsearch indices could be duplicated during a package upgrade, due to an `elasticsearch-upgrade` service running multiple times in parallel.
    - Repository cache servers could serve data from non-cache locations even when the data was available in the local cache location.
    - When converting a user account to an organization, if the user account was an owner of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} enterprise account, the converted organization would incorrectly appear in the enterprise owner list.
    - The `/stafftools/users/ip_addresses/:address` page responded with a `500 Internal Server Error` when attempting to display the page for an IPv6 address.
    - Creating an impersonation OAuth token using the Enterprise Administration REST API resulted in an error when an integration matching the OAuth Application ID already existed.
  changes:
    - Added support for replica domain names that are more than 63 characters.
    - Configuration errors that halt a config apply run are now output to the terminal in addition to the configuration log.
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} features are enabled on your instance, the performance of background jobs has improved when processing batches for repository contributions.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - アップグレードの過程で、カスタムのファイアウォールのルールが削除されます。
    - Git LFSが追跡するファイル[Webインターフェースからアップロードされたもの](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories)が、不正にリポジトリに直接追加されてしまいます。
    - 同じリポジトリ内のファイルパスが255文字を超えるblobへのパーマリンクを含むIssueをクローズできませんでした。
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}のnpmレジストリは、メタデータのレスポンス中で時間の値を返さなくなります。これは、大きなパフォーマンス改善のために行われました。メタデータレスポンスの一部として時間の値を返すために必要なすべてのデータは保持し続け、既存のパフォーマンスの問題を解決した将来に、この値を返すことを再開します。'
    - pre-receive フックの処理に固有のリソース制限によって、pre-receive フックに失敗するものが生じることがあります。

      When using SAML encrypted assertions with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4.0 and 3.4.1, a new XML attribute `WantAssertionsEncrypted` in the `SPSSODescriptor` contains an invalid attribute for SAML metadata. IdPs that consume this SAML metadata endpoint may encounter errors when validating the SAML metadata XML schema. A fix will be available in the next patch release. [Updated: 2022-04-11]

      To work around this problem, you can take one of the two following actions.
      - Reconfigure the IdP by uploading a static copy of the SAML metadata without the `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute.
      - Copy the SAML metadata, remove `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute, host it on a web server, and reconfigure the IdP to point to that URL.

      heading: Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0
      notes:
        - '**{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0 was discontinued on February 16, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.'

      heading: Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1
      notes:
        - '**{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1 will be discontinued on June 3, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date.

      heading: XenServer Hypervisorサポートの非推奨化
      notes:
        - Starting in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} on XenServer was deprecated and is no longer supported. Please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com) with questions or concerns.

      heading: Deprecation of the Content Attachments API preview
      notes:
        - Due to low usage, we have deprecated the Content References API preview in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. The API was previously accessible with the `corsair-preview` header. Users can continue to navigate to external URLs without this API. Any registered usages of the Content References API will no longer receive a webhook notification for URLs from your registered domain(s) and we no longer return valid response codes for attempted updates to existing content attachments.
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of the Codes of Conduct API preview
      notes:
        - 'The Codes of Conduct API preview, which was accessible with the `scarlet-witch-preview` header, is deprecated and no longer accessible in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. We instead recommend using the "[Get community profile metrics](/rest/reference/repos#get-community-profile-metrics)" endpoint to retrieve information about a repository''s code of conduct. For more information, see the "[Deprecation Notice: Codes of Conduct API preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-06-deprecation-notice-codes-of-conduct-api-preview/)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog.'

      heading: Deprecation of OAuth Application API endpoints and API authentication using query parameters
      notes:
        - |
          Starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, the [deprecated version of the OAuth Application API endpoints](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/#endpoints-affected) have been removed. If you encounter 404 error messages on these endpoints, convert your code to the versions of the OAuth Application API that do not have `access_tokens` in the URL. We've also disabled the use of API authentication using query parameters. We instead recommend using [API authentication in the request header](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/#changes-to-make).

      heading: Deprecation of the CodeQL runner
      notes:
        - The {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} runner is deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4 and is no longer supported. The deprecation only affects users who use {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} code scanning in third party CI/CD systems; {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} users are not affected. We strongly recommend that customers migrate to the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} runner. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-21-codeql-runner-deprecation/).
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of custom bit-cache extensions
      notes:
        - |
          Starting in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1, support for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s proprietary bit-cache extensions began to be phased out. These extensions are deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 onwards.

          Any repositories that were already present and active on {% data variables.product.product_location %} running version 3.1 or 3.2 will have been automatically updated.

          Repositories which were not present and active before upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 may not perform optimally until a repository maintenance task is run and has successfully completed.

          To start a repository maintenance task manually, browse to `https://<hostname>/stafftools/repositories/<owner>/<repository>/network` for each affected repository and click the Schedule button.
  backups:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.4.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).'
