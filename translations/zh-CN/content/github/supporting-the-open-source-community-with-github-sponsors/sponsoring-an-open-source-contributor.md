### About sponsorships

{% data reusables.sponsors.sponsorship-details %}

You can sponsor an account on behalf of your user account to invest in projects that you personally benefit from. You can sponsor an account on behalf of your organization for many reasons.
- Sustaining specific libraries that your organization's work depends on
- Investing in the ecosystem you rely on as a organization (such as blockchain)
- Developing brand awareness as an organization that values open source
- Thanking open source developers for building libraries that complement the product your organization offers

You can use a credit card to sponsor an account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. If your organization wants to be invoiced, [contact us](https://support.github.com/contact/org-sponsors-waitlist).

{% data reusables.sponsors.no-fees %} 更多信息请参阅“[关于 {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} 的计费](/articles/about-billing-for-github-sponsors)”。

When you sponsor an account using a credit card, the change will become effective immediately. {% data reusables.sponsors.prorated-sponsorship %}

{% data reusables.sponsors.manage-updates-for-orgs %}

If the sponsored account retires your tier, the tier will remain in place for you until you choose a different tier or cancel your subscription. 更多信息请参阅“[升级赞助](/articles/upgrading-a-sponsorship)”和“[降级赞助](/articles/downgrading-a-sponsorship)”。

If the account you want to sponsor does not have a profile on {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}, you can encourage the account to join. For more information, see "[Setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for your user account](/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-user-account)" and "[Setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for your organization](/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization)." {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will send you the appropriate forms, notify you when they are due, and give you a reasonable amount of time to complete and send in the forms.
