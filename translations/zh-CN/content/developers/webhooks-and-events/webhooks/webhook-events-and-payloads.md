{% data reusables.webhooks.webhooks_intro %}

You can create webhooks that subscribe to the events listed on this page. Each webhook event includes a description of the webhook properties and an example payload. For more information, see "[Creating webhooks](/webhooks/creating/)."

## Webhook payload object common properties

Each webhook event payload also contains properties unique to the event. You can find the unique properties in the individual event type sections.

Key | Type | Description
----|------|-------------
`action` | `string` | Most webhook payloads contain an `action` property that contains the specific activity that triggered the event.
{% data reusables.webhooks.sender_desc %} This property is included in every webhook payload.
{% data reusables.webhooks.repo_desc %} Webhook payloads contain the `repository` property when the event occurs from activity in a repository.
{% data reusables.webhooks.org_desc %}
{% data reusables.webhooks.app_desc %} For more information, see "[Building {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}](/apps/building-github-apps/)."

The unique properties for a webhook event are the same properties you'll find in the `payload` property when using the [Events API](/rest/reference/activity#events). One exception is the [`push` event](#push). The unique properties of the `push` event webhook payload and the `payload` property in the Events API differ. The webhook payload contains more detailed information.

{% tip %}

**Note:** Payloads are capped at 25 MB. If your event generates a larger payload, a webhook will not be fired. This may happen, for example, on a `create` event if many branches or tags are pushed at once. We suggest monitoring your payload size to ensure delivery.

{% endtip %}

### Delivery headers

HTTP POST payloads that are delivered to your webhook's configured URL endpoint will contain several special headers:

Header | Description
-------|-------------|
`X-GitHub-Event`| Name of the event that triggered the delivery.
`X-GitHub-Delivery`| A [GUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier) to identify the delivery.{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}
`X-GitHub-Enterprise-Version` | The version of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance that sent the HTTP POST payload.
`X-GitHub-Enterprise-Host` | The hostname of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance that sent the HTTP POST payload.{% endif %}{% ifversion not ghae %}
`X-Hub-Signature`| This header is sent if the webhook is configured with a [`secret`](/rest/reference/repos#create-hook-config-params). This is the HMAC hex digest of the request body, and is generated using the SHA-1 hash function and the `secret` as the HMAC `key`.{% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %} `X-Hub-Signature` is provided for compatibility with existing integrations, and we recommend that you use the more secure `X-Hub-Signature-256` instead.{% endif %}{% endif %}
`X-Hub-Signature-256`| This header is sent if the webhook is configured with a [`secret`](/rest/reference/repos#create-hook-config-params). This is the HMAC hex digest of the request body, and is generated using the SHA-256 hash function and the `secret` as the HMAC `key`.

Also, the `User-Agent` for the requests will have the prefix `GitHub-Hookshot/`.

### Example delivery
