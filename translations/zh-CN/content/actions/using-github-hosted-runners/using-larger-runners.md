## Overview of {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s

In addition to the [standard {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources), {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} also offers customers on {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} plans a range of {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s with more RAM and CPU. These runners are hosted by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and have the runner application and other tools preinstalled.

When you add a {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} to an organization, you are defining a type of machine from a selection of available hardware specifications and operating system images. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will then create multiple instances of this runner that scale up and down to match the job demands of your organization, based on the autoscaling limits you define.

## Architectural overview of {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s

The {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s are managed at the organization level, where they are arranged into groups that can contain multiple instances of the runner. They can also be created at the enterprise level and shared with organizations in the hierarchy. Once you've created a group, you can then add a runner to the group and update your workflows to target the label assigned to the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}. You can also control which repositories are permitted to send jobs to the group for processing. For more information about groups, see "[Controlling access to {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/controlling-access-to-larger-runners)."

In the following diagram, a class of hosted runner named `ubuntu-20.04-16core` has been defined with customized hardware and operating system configuration.

![Diagram explaining {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}](/assets/images/hosted-runner.png)

1. Instances of this runner are automatically created and added to a group called `ubuntu-20.04-16core`. 
2. The runners have been assigned the label `ubuntu-20.04-16core`. 
3. Workflow jobs use the `ubuntu-20.04-16core` label in their `runs-on` key to indicate the type of runner they need to execute the job.
4. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} checks the runner group to see if your repository is authorized to send jobs to the runner.
5. The job runs on the next available instance of the `ubuntu-20.04-16core` runner.

## Autoscaling {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s

Your {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s can be configured to automatically scale to suit your needs. When jobs are submitted for processing, more machines can be automatically provisioned to run the jobs, until reaching a pre-defined maximum limit. Each machine only handles one job at a time, so these settings effectively determine the number of jobs that can be run concurrently. 

During the runner deployment process, you can configure the _Max_ option, which allows you to control your costs by setting the maximum parallel number of machines that are created in this set. A higher value here can help avoid workflows being blocked due to parallelism.

## Networking for {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s

By default, {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s receive a dynamic IP address that changes for each job run. Optionally, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} customers can configure their {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s to receive a static IP address from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s IP address pool. When enabled, instances of the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} will receive an address from a range that is unique to the runner, allowing you to use this range to configure a firewall allowlist. {% ifversion fpt %}You can use up to 10 static IP address ranges in total across all your {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s{% endif %}{% ifversion ghec %}You can use up to 10 static IP address ranges for the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s created at the enterprise level. In addition, you can use up to 10 static IP address ranges for the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s created at the organization level, for each organization in your enterprise{% endif %}.

{% note %}

**Note**: If runners are unused for more than 30 days, their IP address ranges are automatically removed and cannot be recovered.

{% endnote %}

## Planning for {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s

### Create a runner group

Runner groups are used to collect sets of virtual machines and create a security boundary around them. You can then decide which organizations or repositories are permitted to run jobs on those sets of machines. During the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} deployment process, the runner can be added to an existing group, or otherwise it will join a default group. You can create a group by following the steps in "[Controlling access to {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/controlling-access-to-larger-runners)."

### Understanding billing

{% note %}

**Note**: The {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s do not use included entitlement minutes, and are not free for public repositories.

{% endnote %}

Compared to standard {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners, {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s are billed differently. For more information, see "[Per-minute rates](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#per-minute-rates)".

## Adding a {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} to an enterprise

You can add {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s to an enterprise, where they can be assigned to multiple organizations. The organization admins can then control which repositories can use the runners. To add a {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} to an enterprise, you must be an enterprise owner.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.actions-runners-tab %}
{% data reusables.actions.add-hosted-runner %}
1. To allow organizations to access your {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s, you specify the list of organizations that can use it. For more information, see "[Managing access to your runners](#managing-access-to-your-runners)."

1. To allow repositories to access your {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s, add them to the list of repositories that can use it. For more information, see "[Managing access to your runners](#managing-access-to-your-runners)."

## Running jobs on your runner

Once your runner type has been defined, you can update your workflow YAML files to send jobs to your newly created runner instances for processing. In this example, a runner group is populated with Ubuntu 16-core runners, which have been assigned the label `ubuntu-20.04-16core`. If you have a runner matching this label, the `check-bats-version` job then uses the `runs-on` key to target that runner whenever the job is run:

```yaml
name: learn-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04-16core
    steps:
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-setup-node %}
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
```

To find out which runners are enabled for your repository and organization, you must contact your organization admin. Your organization admin can create new runners and runner groups, as well as configure permissions to specify which repositories can access a runner group.

## Managing access to your runners

{% note %}

**Note**: Before your workflows can send jobs to {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s, you must first configure permissions for the runner group. See the following sections for more information.

{% endnote %}

Runner groups are used to control which repositories can run jobs on your {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}s. You must grant access to the group from each level of the management hierarchy, depending on where you've defined the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %}:

- **Runners at the enterprise level**: Configure the runner group to grant access to all the required organizations. In addition, for each organization, you must configure the group to specify which repositories are allowed access.
- **Runners at the organization level**: Configure the runner group by specifying which repositories are allowed access.

For example, the following diagram has a runner group named `grp-ubuntu-20.04-16core` at the enterprise level. Before the repository named `octo-repo` can use the runners in the group, you must first configure the group at the enterprise level to allow access from the `octo-org` organization; you must then configure the group at the organization level to allow access from `octo-repo`:

### Allowing repositories to access a runner group

This procedure demonstrates how to configure group permissions at the enterprise and organization levels:

{% data reusables.actions.runner-groups-navigate-to-repo-org-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.actions.settings-sidebar-actions-runner-groups-selection %}
  - For runner groups in an enterprise: under **Organization access**, modify which organizations can access the runner group.
  - For runner groups in an organization: under **Repository access**, modify which repositories can access the runner group.
