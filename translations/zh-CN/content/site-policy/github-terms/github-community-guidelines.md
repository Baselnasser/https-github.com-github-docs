全球数以百万计的开发人员在 GitHub 上托管了数百万个项目，包括开源和闭源项目。 我们很幸运能够每天促进开发人员社区的协作，这是我们很重视的责任。 走在一起，我们都有机会让这个社区成为我们值得骄傲的地方。

我们多样化的用户群带来了不同的观点、想法和经验，从上周创建第一个“Hello World”项目的人到世界上最知名的软件开发人员。 我们致力于将 GitHub 营造成一个欢迎社区提供所有不同声音和观点的环境，同时为开发人员提供一个尽其所能工作的地方。

By outlining what we think a [safe, welcoming, and productive community](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) looks like at GitHub, we hope to help you understand how best to interact and collaborate on our platform in line with our [Terms of Service](/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) and [Acceptable Use Policies](/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies).

We encourage our community members to communicate expectations clearly, [moderate](#what-if-something-or-someone-offends-you) their projects where possible, and [report](https://github.com/contact/report-abuse) any content that may violate our [policies](/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service). GitHub Staff will investigate any reports of abuse, and may moderate public content on our site that we determine to be in violation of our Terms of Service.


## Maintaining a strong community

GitHub 社区的主要目的是协作处理软件项目。 我们致力于维持一个用户能够自由表达意见并对彼此想法（包括技术和其他方面）提出挑战的社区。 同时，重要的是用户保持尊重，并为其他人留出公开贡献的空间。 为了营造一个安全和富有成效的环境，我们鼓励社区成员参考这些准则，以了解如何在我们的平台上进行互动。  下面，您将找到一些有关如何作为 GitHub 社区的重要成员进行成功互动的建议。

* **热情和开放** - 每天都有新用户加入我们的社区。 有些是成熟的开发人员，而另一些则刚入门。 请对其他想法和经验水平持开放态度。 为您自己以外的意见留出空间，欢迎新的合作者和刚入门的合作者。

* **尊重** - 在协作环境中工作意味着可能会发生分歧。 但请记住，您的批评要对事不对人。 分享深思熟虑的、建设性的批评，并对与您互动的人保持礼貌。 如果您无法恭敬地参与，请考虑退后一步或使用我们的一些审核工具来缓解紧张局势。

* **富有同情心** - GitHub 是一个全球性社区，拥有来自不同背景和观点的人，其中很多可能与您不同。 试着设身处地为他人着想，在解决问题之前，先了解他们的感受。 尽最大努力帮助 GitHub 成为一个任何人都能安全地做出贡献、参与讨论和分享不同想法的社区。


## 如果某事或某人冒犯您会怎么样？

While some disagreements can be resolved with direct, respectful communication between community members, we understand that is not always the case. We encourage our community to [let us know](https://support.github.com/contact/report-abuse?category=report-abuse&report=other&report_type=unspecified) when they believe content or activity they’ve encountered violates our policies. However, if you run into something or someone on the site that you find objectionable, here are some ways GitHub enables you to take action:

* **Communicate expectations** - Maintainers can set community-specific guidelines to help users understand how to interact with their projects, for example, in a repository’s README, [CONTRIBUTING file](/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/), or [dedicated code of conduct](/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/). You can find additional information on building communities [here](/communities).


* **Moderate Comments** - Users with [write-access privileges](/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/) for a repository can [edit, delete, or hide anyone's comments](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-disruptive-comments) on commits, pull requests, and issues. 对仓库具有读取权限的任何人都可查看评论的编辑历史记录。 Comment authors and people with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a [comment's edit history](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment). Moderating your projects can feel like a big task if there is a lot of activity, but you can [add collaborators](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository#collaborator-access-for-a-repository-owned-by-a-user-account) to assist you in managing your community.

* **Lock Conversations**  - If a discussion in an issue, pull request, or commit gets out of hand, off topic, or violates your project’s code of conduct or GitHub’s policies, owners, collaborators, and anyone else with write access can put a temporary or permanent [lock](/articles/locking-conversations/) on the conversation.

* **Block Users**  - If you encounter a specific user who you would rather not engage with, you can [block the user from your personal account](/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account/) or [from your organization](/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization/).

* **Limit Interactions** - If your public project is getting unwanted attention, being trolled, spammed, or otherwise, you have the option of setting [temporary interaction limits](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository) to keep certain users from interacting with your repository. You can even set [code review limits](https://github.blog/2021-11-01-github-keeps-getting-better-for-open-source-maintainers/#preventing-drive-by-pull-request-approvals-and-requested-changes) to ensure quality contributions on your projects.


While we are passionate about empowering maintainers to moderate their own projects, please reach out to us to {% data variables.contact.report_abuse %} if you need additional support in dealing with a situation.

## What happens if someone violates GitHub's policies?

We rely on reports from the community, as well as proactive detection, to help ensure that GitHub is a safe, welcoming, and productive platform for software developers. There are a variety of factors we consider when we’re made aware of behavior or content not in line with GitHub’s policies. However, our policy enforcement and content moderation approach prioritizes our vision to be the home for all developers. This means:

- We optimize for code collaboration. We recognize that code can have multiple uses and we distinguish between how the code is being used on the platform and other possible uses. We also think about how our enforcement actions can affect a potentially complicated web of interdependencies across the platform and aim to restrict as little legitimate content as possible.

- We take a human-centered approach to content moderation and we tailor our responses to meet the needs of a specific situation. Our global team investigates the reports we receive on a case-by-case basis—considering context and the surrounding facts—before taking action. This could include taking into account potentially offensive content being posted in a way that lacks context or makes it easy for other users to unwittingly view or interact with while using GitHub. In those instances, we may favor moderation in order to safeguard our community.

- Our decisions are rooted in our core belief that serving an interconnected community and empowering human progress through developer collaboration requires a commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging.

Where we have decided that moderation action is warranted, these are some of the ways we may respond:

* Removing the offending content
* Blocking or disabling the offending content
* Downgrading the visibility of the offending content
* Hiding a user account or organization from public view
* Suspending a user account or organization


## 申诉和恢复

If your content or account has been disabled or restricted and you seek reinstatement or wish to appeal, please see our [Appeal and Reinstatement page](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement) for information about the process and use our [Appeal and Reinstatement form](https://support.github.com/contact/reinstatement) to submit a request.

## 法律声明

我们将这些社区指导方针专用于公共领域，让所有人根据 [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) 的条款使用、重新使用、调整或适应。

这些只是指导方针；不影响我们的[服务条款](/articles/github-terms-of-service/)，也不打算作为完整的清单。 Under those terms, GitHub retains full discretion to remove any content or terminate any accounts for activity that violates our [Acceptable Use Policies](/articles/github-acceptable-use-policies). 这些指导方针说明了我们何时将行使这一酌处权。
