## 关于印度储备银行的经常性支付法规

印度储备银行 (RBI) 的一项新支付法规最近生效。 该法规对经常性在线交易提出了额外的要求，并阻止印度一些 {% data variables.product.company_short %} 客户进行定期付款。 对 {% data variables.product.product_name %} 上的任何定期交易使用印度颁布的付款方式的客户，可能会发现他们的付款被银行或发卡机构拒绝。 更多信息请参阅 [RBI 的新闻稿](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51353)。

该法规适用于所有经常性交易，包括：
- {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan subscriptions (Pro, Team, Enterprise)
- {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchases
- {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} transactions
- Git Large File Storage purchases
- {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, and {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} consumption

In order to minimize disruption, recurring payments for our affected customers were paused on October 29th, 2021. Paid features and services have remained available to customers impacted by the RBI regulation.

## About one-time payments on {% data variables.product.company_short %}

As we work with our payment gateway provider to meet the new requirements, we are providing a temporary one-time payment option for impacted customers in India. From February 15th 2022, {% data variables.product.company_short %} customers in India who have been affected by the new RBI regulation will be able to make one-time payments on their regular billing cycle cadence.

### For customers on monthly billing

Customers on monthly billing plans will be able to make a one-time payment on the same day their billing cycle usually renews. For example, if you're usually billed on the 7th of each month, you will now be able to make a one-time payment from your account from the 7th of each month. Your first one-time payment will also include any accrued usage from October 2021 onwards.

If you are currently billed monthly, and would like to switch to yearly billing, you can reduce the frequency of your one-time payments. For more information, see "[Changing the duration of your billing cycle](/en/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/changing-the-duration-of-your-billing-cycle)."

### For customers on yearly billing

If you are billed yearly, and your renewal date was between October 1st, 2021 and February 14th, 2022, you will be able to make a one-time payment for your annual subscriptions from February 15th. This initial payment will include the prorated outstanding cost of your subscription for the period since your previous billing cycle ended.

If your billing cycle is due to renew after February 15th, we will attempt to take the recurring payment. If the payment attempt is declined, you will then be able to make a one-time payment through your account's billing page.

In the meantime, we are actively working with our payment partners to restore recurring payments for impacted customers. For more information or questions, you can contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).

### Impact to {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}

Existing sponsorships will remain in place during this period and maintainers will continue to be paid out as expected. Payments for the accrued sponsorship amounts from the funding account will be collected at the same time as other accrued charges.

**Note**: Affected customers will receive an email notification with a link to their billing settings when payment is due. Two further reminder emails will be sent 7 and 14 days later if payment has not been made. After 14 days, paid features and services will be locked until payment is made.
