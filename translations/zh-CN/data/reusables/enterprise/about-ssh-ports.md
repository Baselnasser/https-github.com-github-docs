Each {% data variables.product.product_name %} instance accepts SSH connections over two ports. Site administrators can access the administrative shell via SSH, then run command-line utilities, troubleshoot, and perform maintenance. Users can connect via SSH to access and write Git data in the instance's repositories. Users do not have shell access to your instance. 更多信息请参阅以下文章。
