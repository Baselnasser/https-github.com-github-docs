Your team can collaborate on {% data variables.product.product_name %} by using an organization account, which serves as a container for your shared work and gives the work a unique name and brand.

Each person that uses {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} always signs into a personal account, and multiple personal accounts can collaborate on shared projects by joining the same organization account. 可以为这些个人帐户的子集指定为组织所有者的角色，这允许这些人员使用复杂的安全和管理功能精细地管理对组织资源的访问。
