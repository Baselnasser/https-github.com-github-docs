To enforce the IP allow list, you must first add IP addresses to the list, then enable the IP allow list.{% ifversion ip-allow-list-address-check %} After you complete your list, you can check whether a particular IP address would be allowed by any of the enabled entries in the list.{% endif %}

您必须先添加当前 IP 地址或匹配范围，然后才能启用 IP 允许列表。
