Additionally, you can use the Dependency submission API (beta) to submit dependencies from the package manager or ecosystem of your choice, even if the ecosystem is not supported by dependency graph for manifest or lock file analysis. 依赖关系图将显示按生态系统分组的已提交依赖项，但与从清单或锁定文件解析的依赖项分开显示。 For more information on the Dependency submission API, see "[Using the Dependency submission API](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)."
