{% note %}

**Note:** You must set a non-zero spending limit before you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}.

{% endnote %}

By default, your organization or enterprise will have a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} spending limit of $0. This prevents new codespaces from being created, or existing codespaces from being opened, if this would incur a billable cost to your organization or enterprise. 若要允许用户在组织中创建代码空间，请将限制设置为大于 $0 的值。
