  bugs:
    - After unlocking a repository for temporary access, a site administrator was unable to manage settings for security products in the repository.
    - Duplicate administrative SSH keys could appear in both the Management Console and the `/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
    - The site admin page for individual users at <code>http(s)://<em>HOSTNAME</em>/stafftools/users/<em>USERNAME</em>/admin</code> contained functionality not intended for GitHub Enterprise Server.
    - In some cases, running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` could replicate an empty configuration to existing nodes in a cluster.
    - In some cases, configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` did not complete, or returned a `Container count mismatch` error.
    - After updating a self-signed TLS certificate on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, UI elements on some pages in the web interface did not appear.
    - In some cases, background tasks could stall due to a library that was used concurrently despite not being thread-safe.
    - The site admin bar at the top of the web interface contained a broken link to the SHA for the currently running version of the application.
    - Organization owners were unable to set the level of access required to create discussions.
    - Discussions users were incorrectly directed to the community guidelines for GitHub.com.
    - In some cases, users were incorrectly instructed to verify their email before creating a discussion.
    - Alerts from secret scanning for GitHub Advanced Security customers were missing in the web UI and REST API if a site administrator did not upgrade directly to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. The alerts are now visible.
  changes:
    - Generation of support bundles is faster as a result of parallelized log sanitization. For more information about support bundles, see "[Providing data to GitHub Support](/support/contacting-github-support/providing-data-to-github-support)."
    - APIs that contain the `organization` or `org` route now accept either the organization's slug or ID. Previously, the APIs only accepted slugs, which caused `Link` headers for GitHub Advanced Security endpoints to be inaccessible. For more information, see "[Organizations](https://docs.github.com/rest/orgs/orgs)" in the REST API documentation.
    - 'The enterprise audit log now includes more user-generated events, such as `project.create`. The REST API also returns additional user-generated events, such as `repo.create`. For more information, see "[Accessing the audit log for your enterprise](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/accessing-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)" and "[Using the audit log API for your enterprise](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise#querying-the-audit-log-rest-api)."'
    - In some cases, cache replicas could reject some Git operations on recently updated repositories. For more information about repository caching, see "[About repository caching](/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/about-repository-caching)."
    - 'You can now configure the global announcement banner to be dismissable using the REST API. For more information, see "[Customizing user messages for your enterprise](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/customizing-user-messages-for-your-enterprise#creating-a-global-announcement-banner)."'
  known_issues:
    - 在新建的没有任何用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 实例上，攻击者可以创建第一个管理员用户。
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - 对 GitHub Connect 启用“用户可以搜索 GitHub.com”后，私有和内部仓库中的议题不包括在 GitHub.com 搜索结果中。
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm 注册表不再返回元数据响应的时间值。这样做是为了大幅改善性能。作为元数据响应的一部分，我们继续拥有返回时间值所需的所有数据，并将在我们解决现有性能问题后恢复返回这个值。'
    - 特定于处理预接收挂钩的资源限制可能会导致某些预接收挂钩失败。
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
    - Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
