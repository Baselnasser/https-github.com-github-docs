          Repository caching is generally available. Repository caching increases Git read performance for distributed developers, providing the data locality and convenience of geo-replication without impact on push workflows. With the general availability release, GitHub Enterprise Server caches both Git and Git LFS data. For more information, see "[About repository caching](/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/about-repository-caching)."

          GitHub has changed the supported algorithms and hash functions for all SSH connections to GitHub Enterprise Server, disabled the unencrypted and unauthenticated Git protocol, and optionally allowed the advertisement of an Ed25519 host key. For more information, see the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-28-improving-git-protocol-security-on-github-enterprise-server/) and the following articles.

          Server Statistics is now generally available. Server Statistics collects aggregate usage data from your GitHub Enterprise Server instance, which you can use to better anticipate the needs of your organization, understand how your team works, and show the value you get from GitHub Enterprise Server.

          Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can optionally add a comment when dismissing a code scanning alert in the web UI or via the REST API. Dismissal comments appear in the event timeline. Users can also add or retrieve a dismissal comment via the REST API.

          On instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license, secret scanning prevents the leak of secrets in the web editor.

          Enterprise owners and users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can view secret scanning alerts and bypasses of secret scanning's push protection in the enterprise and organization audit logs, and via the REST API. For more information, see the following documentation.

          Enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can perform dry runs of custom secret scanning patterns for the enterprise, and all users can perform dry runs when editing a pattern. Dry runs allow you to understand a pattern's impact across the entire instance and hone the pattern before publication and generation of alerts. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."

          Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can use `sort` and `direction` parameters in the REST API when retrieving secret scanning alerts, and sort based on the alertâ€™s `created` or `updated` fields. The new parameters are available for the entire instance, or for individual organizations or repositories. For more information, see the following documentation.

          The contents of the `github/codeql-go` repository have moved to the `github/codeql` repository, to live alongside similar libraries for all other programming languages supported by CodeQL. The open-source CodeQL queries, libraries, and extractor for analyzing codebases written in the Go programming language with GitHub's CodeQL code analysis tools can now be found in the new location. For more information, including guidance on migrating your existing workflows, see [github/codeql-go#741](https://github.com/github/codeql-go/issues/741).

          Enterprise owners on instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license can see an overview of Dependabot alerts for the entire instance, including a repository-centric view of application security risks, and an alert-centric view of all secret scanning and Dependabot alerts. The views are in beta and subject to change, and alert-centric views for code scanning are planned for a future release of GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Viewing the security overview](/code-security/security-overview/viewing-the-security-overview#viewing-the-security-overview-for-an-enterprise)."

          Users can select multiple Dependabot alerts, then dismiss or reopen or dismiss the alerts. For example, from the **Closed alerts** tab, you can select multiple alerts that have been previously dismissed, and then reopen them all at once.
