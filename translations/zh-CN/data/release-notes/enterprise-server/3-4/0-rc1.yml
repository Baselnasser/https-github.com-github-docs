    - heading: Repositories changes
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1944
        - |
          A "Manage Access" section is now shown on the "Collaborators and teams" page in your repository settings. The new section makes it easier for repository administrators to see and manage who has access to their repository, and the level of access granted to each user. Administrators can now:

          * Search all members, teams and collaborators who have access to the repository.
          * View when members have mixed role assignments, granted to them directly as individuals or indirectly via a team. This is visualized through a new "mixed roles" warning, which displays the highest level role the user is granted if their permission level is higher than their assigned role.
          * Manage access to popular repositories reliably, with page pagination and fewer timeouts when large groups of users have access.

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1748
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4 includes improvements to the repository invitation experience, such as notifications for private repository invites, a UI prompt when visiting a private repository you have a pending invitation for, and a banner on a public repository overview page when there is an pending invitation.'

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1739
        - You can now use single-character prefixes for custom autolinks. Autolink prefixes also now allow `.`, `-`, `_`, `+`, `=`, `:`, `/`, and `#` characters, as well as alphanumerics. For more information about custom autolinks, see "[Configuring autolinks to reference external resources](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1776

      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1779
        - You can now use the new "Accessibility" settings page to manage your keyboard shortcuts. You can choose to disable keyboard shortcuts that only use single characters like <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>G</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd>, and <kbd>.</kbd> (the period key). For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-16-managing-keyboard-shortcuts-using-accessibility-settings/)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1727
        - You can now choose to use a fixed-width font in Markdown-enabled fields, like issue comments and pull request descriptions. For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-12-fixed-width-font-support-in-markdown-enabled-fields/)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1761

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1758
        - An image URL can now be appended with a theme context, such as `#gh-dark-mode-only`, to define how the Markdown image is displayed to a viewer. For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-24-specify-theme-context-for-images-in-markdown/)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1686

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1754
        - When typing the name of a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} user in issues, pull requests and discussions, the @mention suggester now ranks existing participants higher than other {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} users, so that it's more likely the user you're looking for will be listed.

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1636
        - Right-to-left languages are now supported natively in Markdown files, issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments.

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1731
        - The diff setting to hide whitespace changes in the pull request "Files changed" tab is now retained for your user account for that pull request. The setting you have chosen is automatically reapplied if you navigate away from the page and then revisit the "Files changed" tab of the same pull request.

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1663
        - When using auto assignment for pull request code reviews, you can now choose to only notify requested team members independently of your auto assignment settings. This setting is useful in scenarios where many users are auto assigned but not all users require notification. For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-10-team-member-pull-request-review-notifications-can-be-configured-independently-of-auto-assignment/)."

    - heading: 'Branches changes'
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1526
        - Organization and repository administrators can now trigger webhooks to listen for changes to branch protection rules on their repositories. For more information, see the "[branch_protection_rule](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#branch_protection_rule)" event in the webhooks events and payloads documentation.

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1759
        - When configuring protected branches, you can now enforce that a required status check is provided by a specific {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}. If a status is then provided by a different application, or by a user via a commit status, merging is prevented. This ensures all changes are validated by the intended application. For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-12-01-ensure-required-status-checks-provided-by-the-intended-app/)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1911
        - Only users with administrator permissions are now able to rename protected branches and modify branch protection rules. Previously, with the exception of the default branch, a collaborator could rename a branch and consequently any non-wildcard branch protection rules that applied to that branch were also renamed. For more information, see "[Renaming a branch](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1845
        - Administrators can now allow only specific users and teams to bypass pull request requirements. For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-19-allow-bypassing-required-pull-requests/)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1850
        - Administrators can now allow only specific users and teams to force push to a repository. For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-12-21-specify-who-can-force-push-to-a-repository/)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1796
        - When requiring pull requests for all changes to a protected branch, administrators can now choose if approved reviews are also a requirement. For more information, see the "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-11-10-require-pull-requests-without-requiring-reviews/)."
