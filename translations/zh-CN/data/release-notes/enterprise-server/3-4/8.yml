  bugs:
    - After unlocking a repository for temporary access, a site administrator was unable to manage settings for security products in the repository. 
    - Duplicate administrative SSH keys could appear in both the Management Console and the `/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
    - The site admin page for individual users at <code>http(s)://<em>HOSTNAME</em>/stafftools/users/<em>USERNAME</em>/admin</code> contained functionality not intended for GitHub Enterprise Server.  
    - In some cases, running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` could replicate an empty configuration to existing nodes in a cluster. 
    - In some cases, configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` did not complete, or returned a `Container count mismatch` error. 
    - After updating a self-signed TLS certificate on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, UI elements on some pages in the web interface did not appear. 
    - In some cases, background tasks could stall due to a library that was used concurrently despite not being thread-safe.
  changes:
    - Generation of support bundles is faster as a result of parallelized log sanitization. For more information about support bundles, see "[Providing data to GitHub Support](/support/contacting-github-support/providing-data-to-github-support)."
    - APIs that contain the `organization` or `org` route now accept either the organization's slug or ID. Previously, the APIs only accepted slugs, which caused `Link` headers for GitHub Advanced Security endpoints to be inaccessible. For more information, see "[Organizations](https://docs.github.com/rest/orgs/orgs)" in the REST API documentation. 
    - The enterprise audit log now includes more user-generated events, such as `project.create`. The REST API also returns additional user-generated events, such as `repo.create`. For more information, see "[Accessing the audit log for your enterprise](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/accessing-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)" and "[Using the audit log API for your enterprise](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise#querying-the-audit-log-rest-api)."
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

      After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.
