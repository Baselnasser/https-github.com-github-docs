  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - Upgrading the nodes in a high availability pair with an upgrade package could cause Elasticsearch to enter an inconsistent state in some cases.
    - In some cluster topologies, the command line utilities `ghe-spokesctl` and `ghe-btop` failed to run.
    - Elasticsearch indices could be duplicated during a package upgrade, due to an `elasticsearch-upgrade` service running multiple times in parallel. 
    - When converting a user account to an organization, if the user account was an owner of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} enterprise account, the converted organization would incorrectly appear in the enterprise owner list. 
    - Creating an impersonation OAuth token using the Enterprise Administration REST API worked incorrectly when an integration matching the OAuth Application ID already existed. 
  changes:
    - Configuration errors that halt a config apply run are now output to the terminal in addition to the configuration log. 
    - When attempting to cache a value larger than the maximum allowed in Memcached, an error was raised however the key was not reported.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} starter workflow no longer errors even if the default token permissions for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} are not used. 
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} features are enabled on your instance, the performance of background jobs has improved when processing batches for repository contributions.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
