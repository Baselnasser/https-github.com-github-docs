  security_fixes:
    - "**MEDIUM**: Prevents an attack where an `org` query string parameter can be specified for a GitHub Enterprise Server URL that then gives access to another organization's active committers."
    - "**MEDIUM**: Ensures that `github.company.com` and `github-company.com` are not evaluated by internal services as identical hostnames, preventing a potential server-side security forgery (SSRF) attack."
    - "**LOW**: An attacker could access the Management Console with a path traversal attack via HTTP even if external firewall rules blocked HTTP access."
    - 包已更新到最新的安全版本。
  bugs:
    - Files inside an artifact archive were unable to be opened after decompression due to restrictive permissions.
    - In some cases, packages pushed to the Container registry were not visible in GitHub Enterprise Server's web UI.
    - Management Console would appear stuck on the _Starting_ screen after upgrading an under-provisioned instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5.
    - Redis timeouts no longer halt database migrations while running `ghe-config-apply`.
    - Background job processors would get stuck in a partially shut-down state, resulting in certain kinds of background jobs (like code scanning) appearing stuck.
    - In some cases, site administrators were not automatically added as enterprise owners.
    - Actions workflows calling other reusable workflows failed to run on a schedule.
    - Resolving Actions using GitHub Connect failed briefly after changing repository visibility from public to internal.
  changes:
    - Improved the performance of Dependabot Updates when first enabled.
    - 'Increase maximum concurrent connections for Actions runners to support [the GHES performance target](/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server#review-hardware-requirements).'
    - The GitHub Pages build and synchronization timeouts are now configurable in the Management Console.
    - Added environment variable to configure Redis timeouts.
    - Creating or updating check runs or check suites could return `500 Internal Server Error` if the value for certain fields, like the name, was too long.
    - Improves performance in pull requests' "Files changed" tab when the diff includes many changes.
    - 'The Actions repository cache usage policy no longer accepts a maximum value less than 1 for [`max_repo_cache_size_limit_in_gb`](/rest/actions/cache#set-github-actions-cache-usage-policy-for-an-enterprise).'
    - 'When [deploying cache-server nodes](/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/configuring-a-repository-cache#configuring-a-repository-cache), it is now mandatory to describe the datacenter topology (using the `--datacenter` argument) for every node in the system. This requirement prevents situations where leaving datacenter membership set to "default" leads to workloads being inappropriately balanced across multiple datacenters.'
  known_issues:
    - 在新建的没有任何用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 实例上，攻击者可以创建第一个管理员用户。
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - 对 GitHub Connect 启用“用户可以搜索 GitHub.com”后，私有和内部仓库中的议题不包括在 GitHub.com 搜索结果中。
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm 注册表不再返回元数据响应的时间值。这样做是为了大幅改善性能。作为元数据响应的一部分，我们继续拥有返回时间值所需的所有数据，并将在我们解决现有性能问题后恢复返回这个值。'
    - 特定于处理预接收挂钩的资源限制可能会导致某些预接收挂钩失败。
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - 'Deleted repositories will not be purged from disk automatically after the 90-day retention period ends. This issue is resolved in the 3.5.1 release. [Updated: 2022-06-10]'
