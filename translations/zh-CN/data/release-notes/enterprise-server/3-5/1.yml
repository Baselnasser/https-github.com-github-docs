  security_fixes:
    - 包已更新到最新的安全版本。
  bugs:
    - An internal script to validate hostnames in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} configuration file would return an error if the hostname string started with a "." (period character).
    - In HA configurations where the primary node's hostname was longer than 60 characters, MySQL would fail to be configured.
    - When {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} was enabled but TLS was disabled on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4.1 and later, applying a configuration update would fail.
    - The `--gateway` argument was added to the `ghe-setup-network` command, to allow passing the gateway address when configuring network settings using the command line.
    - 'The [{% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} billing API](/rest/enterprise-admin/billing#get-github-advanced-security-active-committers-for-an-enterprise) endpoints were not enabled and accessible.'
    - Image attachments that were deleted would return a `500 Internal Server Error` instead of a `404 Not Found` error.
    - In environments configured with a repository cache server, the `ghe-repl-status` command incorrectly showed gists as being under-replicated.
    - The "Get a commit" and "Compare two commits" endpoints in the [Commit API](/rest/commits/commits) would return a `500` error if a file path in the diff contained an encoded and escaped unicode character.
    - The calculation of "maximum committers across entire instance" reported in the site admin dashboard was incorrect.
    - An incorrect database entry for repository replicas caused database corruption when performing a restore using {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}.
    - 'A {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} would not be able to subscribe to the [`secret_scanning_alert_location` webhook event](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#secret_scanning_alert_location) on an installation.'
    - The activity timeline for secret scanning alerts wasn't displayed.
    - Deleted repos were not purged after 90 days.
  changes:
    - Optimised the inclusion of metrics when generating a cluster support bundle.
    - In HA configurations where Elasticsearch reported a valid yellow status, changes introduced in a previous fix would block the `ghe-repl-stop` command and not allow replication to be stopped. Using `ghe-repo-stop --force` will now force Elasticsearch to stop when the service is in a normal or valid yellow status.
  known_issues:
    - 在新建的没有任何用户的 {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 实例上，攻击者可以创建第一个管理员用户。
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - 对 GitHub Connect 启用“用户可以搜索 GitHub.com”后，私有和内部仓库中的议题不包括在 GitHub.com 搜索结果中。
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm 注册表不再返回元数据响应的时间值。这样做是为了大幅改善性能。作为元数据响应的一部分，我们继续拥有返回时间值所需的所有数据，并将在我们解决现有性能问题后恢复返回这个值。'
    - 特定于处理预接收挂钩的资源限制可能会导致某些预接收挂钩失败。
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - 'Deleted repositories will not be purged from disk automatically after the 90-day retention period ends. This issue is resolved in the 3.5.1 release. [Updated: 2022-06-10]'
    - 'Management Console may appear stuck on the _Starting_ screen after upgrading an under-provisioned instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5. [Updated: 2022-06-20]'
