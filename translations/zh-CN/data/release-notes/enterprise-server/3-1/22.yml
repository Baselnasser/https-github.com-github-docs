  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - An internal script to validate hostnames in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} configuration file would return an error if the hostname string started with a "." (period character). 
    - In HA configurations where the primary node's hostname was longer than 60 characters, MySQL would fail to be configured.
    - The calculation of "maximum committers across entire instance" reported in the site admin dashboard was incorrect.
    - An incorrect database entry for repository replicas caused database corruption when performing a restore using {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}.
  changes:
    - In HA configurations where Elasticsearch reported a valid yellow status, changes introduced in a previous fix would block the `ghe-repl-stop` command and not allow replication to be stopped. Using `ghe-repo-stop --force` will now force Elasticsearch to stop when the service is in a normal or valid yellow status.
  known_issues:
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is enabled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, teardown of a replica node with `ghe-repl-teardown` will succeed, but may return `ERROR:Running migrations`.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
