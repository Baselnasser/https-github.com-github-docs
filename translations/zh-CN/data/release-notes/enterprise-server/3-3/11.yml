  bugs:
    - Fixed an issue where the files inside the artifact zip archives had permissions of 000 when unpacked using an unzip tool. Now the files will have the permissions set to 644, the same way as it works in GitHub.com.
    - In some cases, the collectd daemon could consume excess memory.
    - In some cases, backups of rotated log files could accumulate and consume excess storage.
    - After an upgrade to a new feature release and subsequent configuration run, Elasticsearch could log excessive exceptions while rebuilding indices.
    - In some cases where a protected branch required more than one approving review, a pull request could be merged with fewer than the required number of approving reviews.
    - On instances using LDAP authentication, the authentication prompt for sudo mode incorrectly placed the cursor within the password field by default when text fields for both a username and password were visible.
  changes:
    - The `ghe-set-password` command-line utility starts required services automatically when the instance is booted in recovery mode.
    - Metrics for `aqueduct` background processes are gathered for Collectd forwarding and display in the Management Console.
    - The location of the database migration and configuration run log, `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`, is now displayed on the page that details a migration in progress.
