    - '**HIGH:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} that could be exploited when building a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site. User-controlled configuration of the underlying parsers used by {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to execute commands on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-10519 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).'

          Supported storage back ends include AWS S3 and MinIO with support for Azure blob coming in a future release. Please note that the current Docker support will be replaced by a beta of the new GitHub Container Registry in the next release. Please review the [updated minimum requirements for your platform](/enterprise/3.0/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance) before you turn on {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}.

          When publishing packages to NuGet, users can now use the `--api-key` option to pass their authentication token instead of writing it into a file. For more information, see [Configuring dotnet CLI for use with GitHub Packages](/enterprise-server@3.0/packages/guides/configuring-dotnet-cli-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package)

    - heading: Advanced Security Secret Scanning beta
      notes:
        - |
          [Secret Scanning beta](https://github.com/features/security) scans public and private repositories for committed credentials, finds secrets, and notifies the secret provider or admin the moment they are committed into a repository.

          Administrators using {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} can [enable and configure](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/configuration/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-appliance) {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} secret scanning. You can review the [updated minimum requirements for your platform](/enterprise/3.0/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance) before you turn on {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} secret scanning.

    - heading: Advanced Security Code Scanning
      notes:
        - |
          [GitHub Advanced Security code scanning](https://github.com/features/security) is now generally available on GitHub Enterprise Server. Organizations who have purchased Advanced Security can use this capability to do static analysis security testing against their code, and prevent vulnerabilities from making it to their production code using CodeQL, our semantic analysis engine. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning on your appliance](/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/configuration/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#running-code-scanning-using-github-actions)"

  changes:
    - heading: Administration Changes
      notes:
        - The webhook events delivery system has been rearchitected for higher throughput, faster deliveries, and fewer delayed messages. It also uses less CPU and memory in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0+.
        - Organization and Enterprise owners can now see when a team member has been promoted to or demoted from being a team maintainer in the audit log through the new `team.promote_maintainer` and `team.demote_maintainer` audit log events. For more information, see "[Audited actions](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/user-management/audited-actions)."
        - Repository maintainers with existing {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites can [easily update their prior default branch name](/enterprise-server@3.0/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites).
        - Additional hardware resources are required to run {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} with any of Actions, Packages or Advanced Security enabled. For more information on the minimum required resources for each supported platform, see "[Setting up a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."
        - Administrators can now [publish a message](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/user-management/customizing-user-messages-for-your-enterprise), which all users must accept. This can help to onboard new users and surface other organization-specific information and policies.

    - heading: Security Changes
      notes:
        - Organization owners can now disable publication of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites from repositories in the organization. Disabling {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for the organization will prevent members from creating new Pages sites but will not unpublish existing sites. For more information, see "[Disabling publication of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites for your organization](/enterprise-server@3.0/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/disabling-publication-of-github-pages-sites-for-your-organization)."
        - A datacenter must be explicitly defined on all nodes before enabling an active replica.
        - All usage of SSH fingerprints has been switched to use SHA256 fingerprints as they are used with OpenSSH since version 6.8 as well. This applies to the web interface and also the API where fingerprints are returned such as in GraphQL. The fingerprints follow the OpenSSH format.
        - SHA-1 and SHA-256 signature headers (two headers) are sent on webhooks.

    - heading: Developer Changes
      notes:
        - Majority of the services running in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0+ are now on containers which internally enables GitHub to iterate fast and ship high quality releases
        - The webhook events delivery system has been rearchitected for higher throughput, faster deliveries, and fewer delayed messages.

    - heading: API Changes
      notes:
        - Administrators can now configure and manage the site-wide announcement banner via the REST API. For more information, see the endpoints for "[GitHub Enterprise administration](/enterprise-server@3.0/rest/reference/enterprise-admin#annoucements)."
        - A new API endpoint enables the exchange of a user to server token for a user to server token scoped to specific repositories. For more information, see "[Apps](/enterprise-server@3.0/rest/reference/apps#create-a-scoped-access-token)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} REST API documentation.
