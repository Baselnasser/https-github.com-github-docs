      **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com). 
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, when upgrading the MySQL master node, the post-upgrade configuration run would take 600 seconds longer than required due to incorrect detection of unhealthy nodes. 
    - |
      If an instance has tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 can take longer than expected. To decrease the risk of a long-running upgrade, before upgrading, someone with administrative SSH access to the instance can run the `ghe-purge-deleted-repositories` script. **Warning**: You cannot restore a purged repository. Use the script with caution. For assistance using the script, contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket). 
    - If a user clicked the link to share feedback or report bugs for the beta of user lists, the web interface responded with a `404` error. 
    - GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`. 
  changes:
    - People with administrative SSH access to an instance can configure the maximum memory usage in gigabytes for Redis using `ghe-config redis.max-memory-gb VALUE`. 
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

      Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.

      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
