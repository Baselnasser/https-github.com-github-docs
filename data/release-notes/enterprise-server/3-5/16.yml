  bugs:
    - In some cases, graphs on the Management Console's monitor dashboard failed to render. 
    - On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, issues in private and internal repositories were not included in users search results for GitHub.com. 
  changes:
    - To avoid a failure during a configuration run on a cluster, validation of `cluster.conf` with the `ghe-cluster-config-check` utility ensures that the `consul-datacenter` field for each node matches the top-level `primary-datacenter` field. 
    - If a site administrator provides an invalid configuration for blob storage for GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages on an instance, the preflight checks page displays details and troubleshooting information.

      Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

      Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
