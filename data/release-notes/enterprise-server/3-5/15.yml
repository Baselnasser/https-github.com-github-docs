      **HIGH**: Addressed an improper authentication vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to modify other users' secret gists by authenticating through an SSH certificate authority. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23761).

      **MEDIUM**: Addressed an incorrect comparison vulnerability that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23762). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
  bugs:
    - "In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance."
    - After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions\[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear. 
    - GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard. 
    - After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase. 
    - On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown. 
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`. 
    - During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations. 
    - When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported. 
    - If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file, pull requests in the repository intermittently failed to display the files validity or updated code owner information, requiring the user to reload the page. 
    - The CSV reports for all users and all active users, available from the site admin dashboard, did not consider recent access using SSH or personal access tokens. 
    - On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, users would not see issues in private and internal repositories in search results for GitHub.com. 
    - GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`. 
  changes:
    - After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot updates, the instance creates the initial set of updates faster. 
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)." 
    - When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)." 
    - To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced. 
    - The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
  known_issues:
    - |
      On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

      Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an appliance from a backup taken on a different host.
