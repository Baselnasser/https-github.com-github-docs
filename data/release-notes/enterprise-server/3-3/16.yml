  security_fixes:
    - "**HIGH**: Added an extra check to harden against a path traversal bug that could lead to remote code execution in GitHub Pages builds on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the instance. [Updated: 2022-12-02]"
    - "**MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209)."
    - "**MEDIUM**: Scoped user-to-server tokens from GitHub Apps could bypass authorization checks in GraphQL API requests when accessing non-repository resources. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/)."
    - "**MEDIUM**: Pull request preview links did not properly sanitize URLs, allowing a malicious user to embed dangerous links in the instances web UI. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com)."
    - The [Create or update file contents API](/rest/repos/contents#create-or-update-file-contents) correctly enforces workflow scope. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com). 
  bugs:
    - Setting the maintenance mode with an IP Exception List would not persist across upgrades. 
    - After configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would send digest emails to suspended users. 
    - If a user configured a pre-receive hook for multiple repositories, the instances **Hooks** page would not always display the correct status for the hook. 
    - Zombie processes no longer accumulate in the `gitrpcd` container. 
  known_issues:
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} may fail to start automatically. To resolve this issue, connect to the appliance via SSH and run the `ghe-actions-start` command.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} storage settings cannot be validated and saved in the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} when "Force Path Style" is selected, and must instead be configured with the `ghe-actions-precheck` command line utility.'
