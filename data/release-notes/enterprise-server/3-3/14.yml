  security_fixes:
    - |
      **HIGH**: A GitHub App could use a scoped user-to-server token to bypass user authorization logic and escalate privileges.
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: The use of a Unicode right-to-left override character in the list of accessible files for a GitHub App could obscure additional files that the app could access.
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - Installation of a TLS certificate failed when the certificate's subject string included UTF-8 characters.
    - Configuration runs could fail when `retry-limit` or `retry-sleep-duration` were manually set by an administrator using `ghe-config`.
    - In some cases, the Management Console's monitor dashboard would not load correctly.
    - Removed a non-functional link for exporting Management Console monitor graphs as a PNG image.
    - When sending a support bundle to GitHub Enterprise Support using `ghe-support-upload`, the `-t` option would not successfully associate the uploaded bundle with the specified ticket.
    - A link back to the security settings for the instance's enterprise account could render an incorrect view.
    - Git clones or fetches over SSH could experience data corruption for transfers over 1GB in size.
    - After a user deleted or restored packages from the web interface, counts for packages could render incorrectly.
    - After successful configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would not send digest emails.
    - Manually disabled GitHub Actions workflows in a repository were re-enabled if the repository received a push containing more than 2048 commits, or if the repository's default branch changed.
    - When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
  known_issues:
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} may fail to start automatically. To resolve this issue, connect to the appliance via SSH and run the `ghe-actions-start` command.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} storage settings cannot be validated and saved in the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} when "Force Path Style" is selected, and must instead be configured with the `ghe-actions-precheck` command line utility.'
