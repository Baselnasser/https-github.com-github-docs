  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - When a manifest file was deleted from a repository, the manifest would not be removed from the repository's "Dependency graph" page. 
    - Resolved a regression that could lead to consistent failures to retrieve artifacts and download log archives for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. In some circumstances we stopped resolving URLs for internal communications that used `localhost`, and instead incorrectly used the instance hostname. 
    - Upgrading the nodes in a high availability pair with an upgrade package could cause Elasticsearch to enter an inconsistent state in some cases. 
    - Rotated log files with the extension `.backup` would accumulate in directories containing system logs.
    - In some cluster topologies, the command line utilities `ghe-spokesctl` and `ghe-btop` failed to run. 
    - Elasticsearch indices could be duplicated during a package upgrade, due to an `elasticsearch-upgrade` service running multiple times in parallel. 
    - In the pull request and commit views, rich diffs would fail to load for some files tracked by Git LFS. 
    - When converting a user account to an organization, if the user account was an owner of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} enterprise account, the converted organization would incorrectly appear in the enterprise owner list. 
    - Creating an impersonation OAuth token using the Enterprise Administration REST API resulted in an error when an integration matching the OAuth Application ID already existed. 
    - The Secret Scanning REST API would return a `500` response code when there were UTF8 characters present in a detected secret. 
    - Repository cache servers could serve data from non-cache locations even when the data was available in the local cache location. 
  changes:
    - Configuration errors that halt a config apply run are now output to the terminal in addition to the configuration log. 
    - When attempting to cache a value larger than the maximum allowed in Memcached, an error was raised however the key was not reported. 
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} features are enabled on your instance, the performance of background jobs has improved when processing batches for repository contributions.
  known_issues:
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} may fail to start automatically. To resolve this issue, connect to the appliance via SSH and run the `ghe-actions-start` command.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} storage settings cannot be validated and saved in the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} when "Force Path Style" is selected, and must instead be configured with the `ghe-actions-precheck` command line utility.'
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 instances installed on Azure and provisioned with 32+ CPU cores would fail to launch, due to a bug present in the current Linux kernel. [Updated: 2022-04-08]'
