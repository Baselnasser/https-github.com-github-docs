    - Support bundles could include sensitive files if {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} was enabled. 
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - When enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}, an error caused some security advisories to temporarily read as no-longer applicable. 
    - Minio processes would have high CPU usage if an old configuration option was present after upgrading {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. 
    - The options to enable `TLS 1.0` and `TLS 1.1` in the Privacy settings of the Management Console were shown, although removal of those protocol versions occurred in an earlier release.
    - In a HA environment, configuring MSSQL replication could require additional manual steps after enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for the first time.
    - A subset of internal configuration files are more reliably updated after a hotpatch. 
    - The `ghe-run-migrations` script would sometimes fail to generate temporary certificate names correctly. 
    - In a cluster environment, Git LFS operations could fail with failed internal API calls that crossed multiple web nodes.
    - Pre-receive hooks that used `gpg --import` timed out due to insufficient `syscall` privileges.
    - In some cluster topologies, webhook delivery information was not available. 
    - Elasticsearch health checks would not allow a yellow cluster status when running migrations. 
    - Repositories would display a non-functional Discussions tab in the web UI. 
    - Organizations created as a result of a user transforming their user account into an organization were not added to the global enterprise account. 
    - Links to inaccessible pages were removed. 
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} deployment graph would display an error when rendering a pending job. 
    - Some instances experienced high CPU usage due to large amounts unnecessary background jobs being queued. 
    - LDAP user sync jobs would fail when trying to sync GPG keys that had been synced previously. 
    - Following a link to a pull request from the users Pull Request dashboard would result in the repository header not loading.

    - The remove team membership API endpoint would respond with an error when attempting to remove member externally managed via a SCIM Group. 
    - A large number of dormant users could cause a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} configuration to fail.

    - The "Site admin mode" link in the site footer did not change state when clicked. 
    - 'The `spokesctl cache-policy rm` command no longer fails with the message `error: failed to delete cache policy`.'
  changes:
    - Memcached connection limits were increased to better accommodate large cluster topologies. 
    - The Dependency Graph API previously ran with a statically defined port. 
    - The default shard counts for cluster-related Elasticsearch shard settings have been updated. 
    - When filtering enterprise members by organization role on the "People" page, the text for the dropdown menu items has been improved. 
    - The “Triage” and “Maintain” team roles are preserved during repository migrations. 
    - Performance has been improved for web requests made by enterprise owners. 
  known_issues:
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} may fail to start automatically. To resolve this issue, connect to the appliance via SSH and run the `ghe-actions-start` command.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
