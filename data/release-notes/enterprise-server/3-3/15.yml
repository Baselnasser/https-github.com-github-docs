    - |
      **HIGH**: Updated dependencies for the Management Console to the latest patch versions, which addresses security vulnerabilities including [CVE-2022-30123](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wq4h-7r42-5hrr) and [CVE-2022-29181](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m).
    - |
      **HIGH**: Added checks to address an improper cache key vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to access private repository files through a public repository. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-23738](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23738).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: Updated GitHub Actions runners to fix a bug that allowed environment variables in GitHub Actions jobs to escape the context of the variable and modify the invocation of `docker` commands directly. For more information, see the [Actions Runner security advisory](https://github.com/actions/runner/security/advisories/GHSA-2c6m-6gqh-6qg3).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: Updated Redis to 5.0.14 to address [CVE-2021-32672](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32672) and [CVE-2021-32762](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32762).
    - |
      **LOW**: Due to a CSRF vulnerability, a `GET` request to the instance's `site/toggle_site_admin_and_employee_status` endpoint could toggle a user's site administrator status unknowingly.
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - |
      After a site administrator made a change that triggered a configuration run, such as disabling GitHub Actions, validation of services would sometimes fail with the message `WARNING: Validation encountered a problem`.
    - |
      After a site administrator installed a hotpatch containing changes to web interface assets such as JavaScript files or images, the instance did not serve the new assets.
    - |
      Deleted assets and assets scheduled to be purged within a repository, such as LFS files, took too long to to be cleaned up.
    - |
      If a user installed a GitHub App for the user account and then converted the account into an organization, the app was not granted organization permissions.
  changes:
    - |
      To ensure that site administrators can successfully complete an upgrade, the instance will now execute a preflight check to ensure that the virtual machine meets minimum hardware requirements. The check also verifies Elasticsearch's health. You can review the current requirements for CPU, memory, and storage for GitHub Enterprise Server in the "Minimum requirements" section within each article in "[Setting up a GitHub Enterprise Server instance](/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."
  known_issues:
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} may fail to start automatically. To resolve this issue, connect to the appliance via SSH and run the `ghe-actions-start` command.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} storage settings cannot be validated and saved in the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} when "Force Path Style" is selected, and must instead be configured with the `ghe-actions-precheck` command line utility.'
