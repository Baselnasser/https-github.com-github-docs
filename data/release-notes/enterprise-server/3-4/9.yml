  features:
    - Repository archives for migrations now include an `is_archived` field. 
  security_fixes:
    - |
      **HIGH**: A GitHub App could use a scoped user-to-server token to bypass user authorization logic and escalate privileges.
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: The use of a Unicode right-to-left override character in the list of accessible files for a GitHub App could obscure additional files that the app could access.
    - |
      **LOW**: Granting a user the ability to bypass branch protections no longer allows the user to bypass the requirement for signature verification.
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - Installation of a TLS certificate failed when the certificate's subject string included UTF-8 characters.
    - Configuration runs could fail when `retry-limit` or `retry-sleep-duration` were manually set by an administrator using `ghe-config`.
    - In some cases, the Management Console's monitor dashboard would not load correctly.
    - Removed a non-functional link for exporting Management Console monitor graphs as a PNG image.
    - The `ghe-find-insecure-git-operations` command did not return all insecure Git operations after each invocation. 
    - In rare cases, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 to 3.4 would incorrectly modify how data is stored, resulting in failures during future upgrades. When upgrading directly to this release from 3.3, the failure will not occur.
    - When sending a support bundle to GitHub Enterprise Support using `ghe-support-upload`, the `-t` option would not successfully associate the uploaded bundle with the specified ticket.
    - A link back to the security settings for the instance's enterprise account could render an incorrect view.
    - Git clones or fetches over SSH could experience data corruption for transfers over 1GB in size.
    - After a user deleted or restored packages from the web interface, counts for packages could render incorrectly.
    - After successful configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would not send digest emails.
    - After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4, releases would appear to be missing from repositories. This occurred when the required Elasticsearch index migrations had not successfully completed. The releases UI now indicates if it is waiting for the Elasticsearch index migrations to complete, and links to documentation on how to observe status and immediately complete the migration. 
    - Manually disabled GitHub Actions workflows in a repository were re-enabled if the repository received a push containing more than 2048 commits, or if the repository's default branch changed.
    - If branch protections were enabled, the `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts for GitHub Actions workflow runs were incorrectly set as `false`.
    - When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
    - When adding a member to an organization, an erroneous SAML SSO trial invitation appeared.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

      After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.
