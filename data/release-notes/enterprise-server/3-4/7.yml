      **CRITICAL**: GitHub Enterprise Server's Elasticsearch container used a version of OpenJDK 8 that was vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. The vulnerability is tracked as [CVE-2022-34169](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9339-86wc-4qgf).
    - |
      **HIGH**: Previously installed apps on user accounts were automatically granted permission to access an organization on scoped access tokens after the user account was transformed into an organization account. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
  bugs:
    - In some cases, GitHub Enterprise Server instances on AWS that used the `r4.4xlarge` instance type would fail to boot.
    - When calculating committers for GitHub Advanced Security, it was not possible to specify individual repositories. For more information, see "[Site admin dashboard](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/site-admin-dashboard#advanced-security-committers)." 
    - When a custom dormancy threshold was set for the instance, suspending all dormant users did not reliably respect the threshold. For more information about dormancy, see "[Managing dormant users](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-dormant-users)."
  changes:
    - '`pre_receive_hook.rejected_push` events were not displayed in the enterprise audit log.'
    - Both migration archives for repositories and archive exports for user accounts include release reactions.
