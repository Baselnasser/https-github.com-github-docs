  security_fixes:
    - Sanitize additional secrets in support bundles and the configuration log.
    - Dependencies for the CodeQL action have been updated to the latest security versions.
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - The metrics `Active workers` and `Queued requests` for `github` (renamed from metadata), `gitauth`, and `unicorn` container services werent correctly read from collectd and displayed in the Management Console.
    - Repositories locked for migration would allow files to be edited in the web UI.
    - The `git-janitor`command was unable to fix outdated `multi-pack-index.lock` files, resulting in the repository failing maintenance.
  changes:
    - |
      The `ghe-support-bundle` and `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` commands were updated to include the `-p/--period` flag to generate a time constrained support bundle. The duration can be specified in days and hours, for example: `-p '2 hours'`, `-p '1 day'`, `-p '2 days 5 hours'`.
    - The performance of configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` has been improved.
    - When upgrading an instance with a new root partition, running the `ghe-upgrade` command with the `-t/--target` option ensures the preflight check for the minimum disk storage size is executed against the target partition.
    - When exporting account data, backing up a repository, or performing a migration, the link to a repository archive now expires after 1 hour. Previously the archive link expired after 5 minutes.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

      After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.
