  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - Resolved a regression that could lead to consistent failures to retrieve artifacts and download log archives for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. In some circumstances we stopped resolving URLs for internal communications that used `localhost`, and instead incorrectly used the instance hostname. 
    - When a manifest file was deleted from a repository, the manifest would not be removed from the repository's "Dependency graph" page. 
    - Upgrading the nodes in a high availability pair with an upgrade package could cause Elasticsearch to enter an inconsistent state in some cases. 
    - Rotated log files with the extension `.backup` would accumulate in directories containing system logs.
    - In some cluster topologies, the command line utilities `ghe-spokesctl` and `ghe-btop` failed to run.
    - Elasticsearch indices could be duplicated during a package upgrade, due to an `elasticsearch-upgrade` service running multiple times in parallel. 
    - Repository cache servers could serve data from non-cache locations even when the data was available in the local cache location.
    - When converting a user account to an organization, if the user account was an owner of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} enterprise account, the converted organization would incorrectly appear in the enterprise owner list. 
    - The `/stafftools/users/ip_addresses/:address` page responded with a `500 Internal Server Error` when attempting to display the page for an IPv6 address. 
    - Creating an impersonation OAuth token using the Enterprise Administration REST API resulted in an error when an integration matching the OAuth Application ID already existed. 
 
  changes:
    - Added support for replica domain names that are more than 63 characters. 
    - Configuration errors that halt a config apply run are now output to the terminal in addition to the configuration log. 
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} features are enabled on your instance, the performance of background jobs has improved when processing batches for repository contributions.

  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

      After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.

  deprecations:
    - heading: Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0
      notes:
        - '**{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0 was discontinued on February 16, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.'
    - heading: Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1
      notes:
        - '**{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1 will be discontinued on June 3, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.'

    - heading: Deprecation of XenServer Hypervisor support
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/docs-content/issues/4439
        - Starting in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} on XenServer was deprecated and is no longer supported. Please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com) with questions or concerns.

    - heading: Deprecation of the Content Attachments API preview
      notes:
        #
        - Due to low usage, we have deprecated the Content References API preview in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. The API was previously accessible with the `corsair-preview` header. Users can continue to navigate to external URLs without this API. Any registered usages of the Content References API will no longer receive a webhook notification for URLs from your registered domain(s) and we no longer return valid response codes for attempted updates to existing content attachments.

    - heading: Deprecation of the Codes of Conduct API preview
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1708
        - 'The Codes of Conduct API preview, which was accessible with the `scarlet-witch-preview` header, is deprecated and no longer accessible in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. We instead recommend using the "[Get community profile metrics](/rest/reference/repos#get-community-profile-metrics)" endpoint to retrieve information about a repository''s code of conduct. For more information, see the "[Deprecation Notice: Codes of Conduct API preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-06-deprecation-notice-codes-of-conduct-api-preview/)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog.'

    - heading: Deprecation of OAuth Application API endpoints and API authentication using query parameters
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1316
        - |
          Starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, the [deprecated version of the OAuth Application API endpoints](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/#endpoints-affected) have been removed. If you encounter 404 error messages on these endpoints, convert your code to the versions of the OAuth Application API that do not have `access_tokens` in the URL. We've also disabled the use of API authentication using query parameters. We instead recommend using [API authentication in the request header](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/#changes-to-make).

    - heading: Deprecation of the CodeQL runner
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1632
        - The {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} runner is deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4 and is no longer supported. The deprecation only affects users who use {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} code scanning in third party CI/CD systems; {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} users are not affected. We strongly recommend that customers migrate to the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} runner. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-21-codeql-runner-deprecation/).

    - heading: Deprecation of custom bit-cache extensions
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1415
        - |
          Starting in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1, support for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s proprietary bit-cache extensions began to be phased out. These extensions are deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 onwards.

          Any repositories that were already present and active on {% data variables.product.product_location %} running version 3.1 or 3.2 will have been automatically updated.

          Repositories which were not present and active before upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 may not perform optimally until a repository maintenance task is run and has successfully completed.

          To start a repository maintenance task manually, browse to `https://<hostname>/stafftools/repositories/<owner>/<repository>/network` for each affected repository and click the Schedule button.
    
    - heading: Theme picker for GitHub Pages has been removed
      notes:
