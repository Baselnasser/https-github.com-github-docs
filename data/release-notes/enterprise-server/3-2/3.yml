  bugs:
    - 'Restore might fail for enterprise server in clustering mode if orchestrator is not healthily.'
    - 'Codespaces links were displayed in organization settings.'
    - 'Several parts of the application were unusable for users who are owners of many organizations.'
    - 'Fixed a link to https://docs.github.com.'
  known_issues:
    - After saving a new release on a repository, the `/releases` page shows a 500 error. A fix for this issue is expected to ship in 3.2.3.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
