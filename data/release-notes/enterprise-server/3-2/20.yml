      **HIGH**: Updated dependencies for the Management Console to the latest patch versions, which addresses security vulnerabilities including [CVE-2022-30123](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wq4h-7r42-5hrr) and [CVE-2022-29181](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
    - |
      **LOW**: Due to a CSRF vulnerability, a `GET` request to the instance's `site/toggle_site_admin_and_employee_status` endpoint could toggle a user's site administrator status unknowingly.
  bugs:
    - |
      After a site administrator installed a hotpatch containing changes to web interface assets such as JavaScript files or images, the instance did not serve the new assets.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
