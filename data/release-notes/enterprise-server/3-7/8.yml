    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: ${% raw %}{{ inputs.strategies }}{% endraw %}`.
    - On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node. 
    - "In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance."
    - After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions\[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear. 
    - GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard. 
    - "In some cases, graphs on the Management Console's monitor dashboard failed to render." 
    - On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown. 
    - After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase. 
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`. 
    - During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations. 
    - "On instances configured to use the private beta of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, users' authentication with SSH keys and personal access tokens failed due to an erroneous requirement for authorization." 
    - |
      After a user imported a repository with push protection enabled, the repository was not immediately visible in the security overview's "Security Coverage" view. 
    - Responses from the `/repositories` REST API endpoint erroneously included deleted repositories. 
    - When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported. 
    - If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file with check annotations, pull requests "Files changed" tab returned a `500` error and displayed "Oops, something went wrong" in the "Unchanged files with check annotations" section. 
    - On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if a user manually triggered a workflow using the REST API but did not specify values for optional booleans, the API failed to validate the request and returned a `422` error. 
    - The CSV reports for all users and all active users, available from the site admin dashboard, did not consider recent access using SSH or personal access tokens. 
    - In some cases on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server erroneously stopped writing to replica fileservers, causing repository data to fall out of sync. 
    - GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`. 
    - On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if code scanning had been used while running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 or earlier, a subsequent upgrade from 3.5 to 3.6 or 3.7 could fail when attempting to add a unique index to a database table. 
  changes:
    - When the dependency submission API received a submission with one or more dependencies without a version, the dependency graph will now correctly report this fact. 
    - To avoid a failure during a configuration run on a cluster, validation of `cluster.conf` with the `ghe-cluster-config-check` utility ensures that the `consul-datacenter` field for each nodes matches the top-level `primary-datacenter` field. 
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)." 
    - When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)." 
    - To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced. 
    - The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
  known_issues:
    - |
      On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

      In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.

      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
