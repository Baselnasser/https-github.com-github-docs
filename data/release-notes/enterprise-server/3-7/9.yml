      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: {% raw %}${{ inputs.strategies }}{% endraw %}`. 
    - Download requests for Git LFS objects did not complete until reporting the final download size, which affected the latency of these requests, particularly on an instance with nodes functioning as repository caches. 
    - For instances with both GitHub Connect and automatic access to GitHub.com actions enabled, Dependabot would fail to update actions hosted on GitHub.com. 
    - In some cases on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users could not load the security analysis page and saw a `500` error. 
    - On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, issues in private and internal repositories were not included in users search results for GitHub.com. 
    - After restoration of a deleted organization, the organization did not appear in the instance's list of organizations. 
    - |
      Collectd logs could grow rapidly in size due to the inclusion of `kredz.*` metrics, which can't be parsed by StatsD and resulted in error messages. 
    - |
      Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.
  changes:
    - If a site administrator provides an invalid configuration for blob storage for GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages on an instance, the preflight checks page displays details and troubleshooting information. 
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

      In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.

    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
