    - During a backup an error "Warning&#58; One or more storage objects were not found on the source appliance." was occurring when attempting to clean up purgeable storage objects.

    - Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - When maintenance mode is enabled, some services continue to be listed as "active processes". The services identified are expected to run during maintenance mode. If you experience this issue and are unsure, contact [GitHub Enterprise Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://premium.githubsupport.com/).
