We recommend using [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to install and run Jekyll. Bundler manages Ruby gem dependencies, reduces Jekyll build errors, and prevents environment-related bugs. To install Bundler:

 1. Install Ruby. For more information, see "[Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)" in the Ruby documentation. Notice that the Jekyll version used in the `github-pages` gem doesn't work with Ruby 3.x, but only 2.x.
 2. Install Bundler. For more information, see "[Bundler](https://bundler.io/)."
