**Warning:** We strongly recommend not using wildcard DNS records, such as `*.example.com`. A wildcard DNS record will allow anyone to host a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site at one of your subdomains even when they are verified. For more information, see "[Verifying your custom domain for {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}](/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages)."
