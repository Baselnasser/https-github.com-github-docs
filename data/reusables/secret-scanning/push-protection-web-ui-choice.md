When you use the web UI to attempt to commit a supported secret to a repository or organization with secret scanning as a push protection enabled, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will block the commit. 

You will see a banner at the top of the page with information about the secret's location, and the secret will also be underlined in the file so you can easily find it.
