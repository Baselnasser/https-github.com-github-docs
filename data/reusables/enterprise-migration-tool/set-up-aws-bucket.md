In AWS, set up a S3 bucket. For more information, see [Creating a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) in the AWS documentation.

You will also need an AWS access key and secret key with `read-write` access to your bucket.

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} does not delete your archive from AWS after your migration is finished. To reduce storage costs, we recommend configuring auto-deletion of your archive after a period of time. For more information, see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html) in the AWS documentation.
