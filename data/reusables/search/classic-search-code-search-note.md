This article refers to the classic {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} search experience. If you are participating in the new code search and code view beta and have enabled the new functionality, the syntax for searching code and the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search interface will differ. However, the search syntax for non-code search types will stay the same.
