{% note %}

**Note:** Starting in March 2023 and through the end of 2023, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will gradually begin to require all users who contribute code on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} to enable one or more forms of two-factor authentication (2FA). If you are in an eligible group, you will receive a notification email when that group is selected for enrollment, marking the beginning of a 45-day 2FA enrollment period, and you will see banners asking you to enroll in 2FA on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. If you don't receive a notification, then you are not part of a group required to enable 2FA, though we strongly recommend it.

For more information about the 2FA enrollment rollout, see [this blog post](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13).
