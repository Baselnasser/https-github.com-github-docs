If you make an internal {% ifversion private-actions %}or private {% endif %}repository accessible to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows in other repositories, outside collaborators on the other repositories can indirectly access the internal {% ifversion private-actions %}or private {% endif %}repository, even though they do not have direct access to these repositories. The outside collaborators can view logs for workflow runs when actions or workflows from the internal {% ifversion private-actions %}or private {% endif %}repository are used.
