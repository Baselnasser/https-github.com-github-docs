To prevent unnecessary workflow runs, scheduled workflows may be disabled automatically. When a public repository is forked, scheduled workflows are disabled by default. In a public repository, scheduled workflows are automatically disabled when no repository activity has occurred in 60 days. You can continue to run scheduled workflows without repository activity by visiting the workflow's page and clicking `Continue running workflow`.
