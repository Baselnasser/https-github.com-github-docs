Always include a security admonition above this procedure. This is either one of the following, depending on whether the context is self-hosted runners or larger runners.

All organizations have a single default runner group. {% ifversion fpt %}Organizations using the {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} plan{% else %}Organizations within an enterprise account{% endif %} can create additional groups. Organization admins can allow individual repositories access to a runner group. For information about how to create a runner group with the REST API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions#self-hosted-runner-groups)."

Runners are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can move a runner from the default group to any group you create.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which repositories{% ifversion restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} have access to the runner group.
