Runner groups are used to control access to runners at the organization and enterprise level. Enterprise owners can configure access policies that control which organizations {% ifversion restrict-groups-to-workflows %}and workflows {% endif %}in an enterprise have access to the runner group. Organization owners can configure access policies that control which repositories{% ifversion restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} in an organization have access to the runner group.

When an enterprise owner grants access to a runner group, organization owners can see the runner group listed in the organization's runner settings. The organization owners can then assign additional granular repository{% ifversion restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflow{% endif %} access policies to the enterprise runner group.
