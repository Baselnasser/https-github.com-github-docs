Once you have a token, you can enter it instead of your password when performing Git operations over HTTPS.

For example, on the command line you would enter the following:

```shell
$ git clone https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/USERNAME/REPO.git
Username: YOUR_USERNAME
Password: YOUR_TOKEN
```
