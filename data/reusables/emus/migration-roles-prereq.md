- You'll need to access both your enterprise on {% data variables.location.product_location %} and your tenant on Azure Active Directory (AD).

  - To configure the {% data variables.product.prodname_emu_idp_oidc_application %} application on Azure AD, you must sign into the Azure AD tenant as a user with the Global Administrator role.
  - To sign in as the setup user for your enterprise on {% data variables.location.product_location %}, you must use a recovery code for the enterprise.
