By default, a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow is triggered every time you create or update a prebuild, or push to a prebuild-enabled branch. As with other workflows, while prebuild workflows are running they will either consume some of the Actions minutes included with your account, if you have any, or they will incur charges for Actions minutes. For more information about pricing for Actions minutes, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions)." 

Alongside {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} minutes, you will also be billed for the storage of prebuilds associated with each prebuild configuration for a given repository and region. Storage of prebuilds is billed at the same rate as storage of codespaces.
