By default, a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow is triggered every time you create or update a prebuild template, or push to a prebuild-enabled branch. As with other workflows, while prebuild workflows are running they will either consume some of the Actions minutes included with your account, if you have any, or they will incur charges for Actions minutes. For more information about pricing for Actions minutes, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions)." 

Alongside {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} minutes, you will also be billed for the storage of prebuild templates associated with each prebuild configuration for a given repository and region. Storage of prebuild templates is billed at the same rate as storage of codespaces. For more information, see "[Calculating storage usage](#calculating-storage-usage)."

To reduce consumption of Actions minutes, you can set a prebuild template to be updated only when you make a change to your dev container configuration files, or only on a custom schedule. You can also manage your storage usage by adjusting the number of template versions to be retained for your prebuild configurations. For more information, see "[Configuring prebuilds](/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/configuring-prebuilds#configuring-a-prebuild)."

If you are an organization owner, you can track usage of prebuild workflows and storage by downloading a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage report for your organization. You can identify workflow runs for prebuilds by filtering the CSV output to only include the workflow called "Create Codespaces Prebuilds." For more information, see "[Viewing your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/viewing-your-github-actions-usage#viewing-github-actions-usage-for-your-organization)."
