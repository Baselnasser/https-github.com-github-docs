Typically, you can run your codespace on a choice of remote machine, from 2 cores to 32 cores. Each of these has a different level of resources and a different billing tier. For information, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)."

By default the machine type with the lowest valid resources is used when you create a codespace.
