To reduce consumption of Actions minutes, you can set a prebuild to be updated only when you make a change to your dev container configuration files, or only on a custom schedule. You can also manage your storage usage by adjusting the number of template versions to be retained for your prebuild configurations. For more information, see "[Configuring prebuilds](/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/configuring-prebuilds#configuring-a-prebuild)."

If you are an organization owner, you can track usage of prebuild workflows and storage by downloading a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage report for your organization. You can identify workflow runs for prebuilds by filtering the CSV output to only include the workflow called "Create {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} Prebuilds." For more information, see "[Viewing your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/viewing-your-github-actions-usage#viewing-github-actions-usage-for-your-organization)."
