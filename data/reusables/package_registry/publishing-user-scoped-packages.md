When you first publish a package, the default visibility is private. When a package is linked to a repository, the package visibility is dependent on the repository's visibility. To change the visibility or set access permissions, see "[Configuring a package's access control and visibility](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility)."
