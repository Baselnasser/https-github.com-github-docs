When configuring a webhook, you can choose which events will send you payloads. To limit the number of HTTP requests to your server, you should only subscribe to the specific events that you plan on handling. By default, webhooks installed on {% ifversion ghes or ghae %} [{% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}](/rest/enterprise-admin#global-webhooks/),{% endif %} an [organization][org-hooks], or a [repository][repo-hooks] are only subscribed to the push event. By default, webhooks on {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s are not subscribed to any events. You can change events that a webhook is subscribed to at any time.
