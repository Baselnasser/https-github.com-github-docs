**Note:** You can only create a new classic project board for an organization, user, or repository that already has at least one classic project board. If you're unable to create a classic project board, create a beta project board instead. For more information, see "[Creating a project (beta)](/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/creating-a-project)."
