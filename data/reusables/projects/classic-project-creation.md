**Note:** You can only create a new classic project board for an organization, user, or repository that already has at least one classic project board. If you're unable to create a classic project board, create a beta project board instead. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project)."
