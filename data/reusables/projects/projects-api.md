**Notes:** 

* This API only applies to project boards. Projects (beta) can be managed with the GraphQL API. For more information, see "[Using the API to manage projects (beta)](/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/using-the-api-to-manage-projects)."
* You can only create a new classic project board for an organization, user, or repository that already has at least one classic project board.
