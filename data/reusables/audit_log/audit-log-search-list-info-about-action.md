The name for each audit log entry is composed of the `action` object or category qualifier, followed by an operation type. For example, the `repo.create` entry refers to the `create` operation on the `repo` category.

Each audit log entry shows applicable information about an event, such as:

- The {% ifversion ghec or ghes or ghae %}enterprise or {% endif %}organization an action was performed in
- The user (actor) who performed the action
- The user affected by the action
- Which repository an action was performed in
- The action that was performed
- Which country the action took place in
- The date and time the action occurred
