{% note %}

**Note:** The ability to enable and disable default set up for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for eligible repositories in an organization is currently in beta and subject to change. During the beta release, if you disable {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for all repositories this change will not be reflected in the coverage information shown in security overview for the organization. The repositories will still appear to have {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} enabled in this view.
