If you run code scanning using multiple configurations, then sometimes an alert will have multiple analysis origins. If an alert has multiple analysis origins, you can view the status of the alert for each analysis origin on the alert page. For more information, see "[About analysis origins](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-analysis-origins)."
