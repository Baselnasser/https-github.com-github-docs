Weâ€™ve created a phased approach to {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} (GHAS) rollouts developed from industry and GitHub best practices. You can utilize this approach for your rollout, either in partnership with {% data variables.product.prodname_professional_services %} or independently.

While the phased approach is recommended, adjustments can be made based on the needs of your organization. We also suggest creating and adhering to a timeline for your rollout and implementation. As you begin your planning, we can work together to identify the ideal approach and timeline that works best for your organization.

Based on our experience helping customers with a successful deployment of GHAS, we expect most customers will want to follow their rollout in our suggested phases.

Depending on the needs of your organization, you may need to modify this approach and alter or remove some phases or steps.
