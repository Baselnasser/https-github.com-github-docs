To make a person an enterprise owner, you must delegate access from your IdP. If you use Azure AD and SCIM, assign the enterprise owner role to the user. For other IdPs, include the `administrator` attribute in the SAML assertion for the user account on the IdP, with the value of `true`. For more information about enterprise owners, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise)." For more information about authentication and provisioning using Azure AD, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-authentication-and-provisioning-for-your-enterprise-using-azure-ad)."
