When you use an IdP for IAM on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, SAML SSO controls and secures access to enterprise resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests. SCIM automatically creates user accounts and manages access to {% data variables.location.product_location %} when you make changes on the IdP. You can also synchronize teams on {% data variables.product.product_name %} with groups on your IdP. For more information, see the following articles.
