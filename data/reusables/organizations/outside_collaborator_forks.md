When you add an outside collaborator to a repository, you'll also need to add them to any forks of the repository you'd like them to access. If you are adding an outside collaborator to a private or internal fork of a repository, the collaborator must be {% ifversion ghec %}a member of the enterprise or {% endif %}a collaborator on the upstream repository.
