1. Decide whether to receive sponsorship payouts via a bank account or through a fiscal host. For more information about setting up and using fiscal hosts, see "[Using a fiscal host to receive GitHub Sponsors payouts](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/using-a-fiscal-host-to-receive-github-sponsors-payouts)."

    Note that you can only set up your fiscal host information at the time you sign up for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}. If you decide you want to switch to using a fiscal host after your profile has been set up, please [contact support](https://support.github.com/contact/account?type=github_sponsors&subject=GitHub+Sponsors:+Fiscal+Host).
