Note that you can only set up your fiscal host information at the time you sign up for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}. If you originally chose to use a Stripe Connect account when you signed up for your profile, but would like to switch to using a fiscal host, please [contact support](https://support.github.com/contact/account?type=github_sponsors&subject=GitHub+Sponsors:+Fiscal+Host).
