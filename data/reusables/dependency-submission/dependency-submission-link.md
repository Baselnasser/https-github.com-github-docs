Additionally, you can use the Dependency submission API (beta) to submit dependencies from the package manager or ecosystem of your choice, even if the ecosystem is not supported by dependency graph for manifest or lock file analysis. The dependency graph will display the submitted dependencies grouped by ecosystem, but separately from the dependencies parsed from manifest or lock files. For more information on the Dependency submission API, see "[Using the Dependency submission API](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)."
