After you create an IP allow list, you can enable allowed IP addresses. When you enable allowed IP addresses, {% data variables.product.company_short %} immediately enforces any enabled entries in your IP allow list.

{% ifversion ip-allow-list-address-check %} 
Before you enable allowed IP addresses, you can check whether a particular IP address would be allowed by any of the enabled entries in your list. For more information, see "[Checking if an IP address is permitted](#checking-if-an-ip-address-is-permitted)."
{% endif %}
