After you create an IP allow list, you can enable allowed IP addresses. When you enable allowed IP addresses, {% data variables.product.company_short %} immediately enforces any enabled entries in your IP allow list.

Before you enable your IP allow list, you can check whether your allow list will permit a connection from a particular IP address. For more information, see "[Checking if an IP address is permitted](#checking-if-an-ip-address-is-permitted)."
