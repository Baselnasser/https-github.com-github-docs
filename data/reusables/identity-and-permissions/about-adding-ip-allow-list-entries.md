You can create an IP allow list by adding entries that each contain an IP address or address range. After you finish adding entries, you can check whether a particular IP address would be allowed by any of the enabled entries in your list.

Before the list restricts access to {% ifversion ghae %}your enterprise{% else %}private assets owned by organizations in your enterprise{% endif %}, you must also enable allowed IP addresses.
