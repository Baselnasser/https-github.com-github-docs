## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
At Fishermans trading Company our Common goal is to elimate any vulnerabil position ,we take as investors.
my goal is to prevent the purchase or sell of any postion that does not seek a higher secruity.
My patterns are consisted of a regular day trading patteren and im noticing when large amounts of units are being sold and bought. 
Now Im able to study this while buying and trading and comparing our patterns.
*Disclammier - I am not a finical advisor, I was caught up in a day trading patteren. That im currently in the procces of fixings all postions and loop holes.*
my goal is to serve the Investor as a helping friend, so we may walk the long road of our investment journet with a few bumps a head out journey. 
Your's truly - Fisherman of Fisherman's Trading Company.
