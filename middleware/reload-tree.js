/**
 * This exists for local previewing. Only.
 * We load in the entire tree on startup, then that's used for things like
 * sidebars and breadcrumbs and landing pages and ToC pages (and possibly
 * more).
 * When an individual page is requested, we always reload it from disk
 * in case it has changed. But that's not feasible with all 1k+ pages.
 *
 * The core of this middleware calls `createTree()` but by passing the
 * optional previous tree so that within `createTree` it can opt to
 * re-use those that haven't changed on disk.
 *
 * The intention here is so that things like sidebars can refresh
 * without having to restart the entire server.
