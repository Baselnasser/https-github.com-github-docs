CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION REPORT
Use this configuration to create a report containing all of the credit card transactions processed in your ADP Payments account for any given date range. The Credit Card Deposit Report contains basic information about your credit card transactions based on settle date. You can use this custom reporting option to look at credit card transactions based on enter date, and to include fields that the standard report does not.

 

To create a credit card transaction report, follow the steps for Creating Custom Reports described above, and use the following filters:sample_report_cctrans.jpg

Check both the Transactions and the Customers checkboxes in the Include in Report section.

Set the Date Range filters to “all,” select a rolling date range, or enter a custom Start date and End date. Then select whether you want to Report on transactions by “Enter date” or “Settle date.”

In the Payment Options section, check only the Credit card box in the Type section.

In the Payment Options section, check the All box under Status.

Suggested fields to add to the report:

Transaction.Transaction ID

Transaction.Transaction Date

Transaction.Status

Transaction.Payment Type

Transaction.Amount

Transaction.Masked CC Number

Transaction.Estimated Settle Date

Transaction.Actual Settlement Date

Transaction.Invoice Number

Transaction.Schedule Id

Customer.Customer ID

Customer.Account Number

Customer.Company

Customer.First Name

Customer.Last Name

Customer.Billing City
