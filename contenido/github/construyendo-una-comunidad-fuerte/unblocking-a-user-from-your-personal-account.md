When you black a user, they'll be able to invite you to be a collaborator to their repositories. If they [@mention you](/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams) anywhere on GitHub, you'll receive notifications.

In repositories you own, the user will be able to collaborate normally.

You can unblock a user in your account settings or from the user's profile page.
