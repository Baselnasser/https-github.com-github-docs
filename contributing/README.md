Chapter 1: Introduction : Feature and Function Overview 2
 Feature and Function Overview
The following functions are available in ADP Payments:
• Echeck (ACH) Payment Processing — Funds are debited directly from your customer's bank account
and deposited into yours.
• Credit Card Processing — Process credit cards at industry‐low rates. Charge a customer’s American
Express, Visa, MasterCard, or Discover card, or credit a customer’s account for a refund due.
• Recurring Payment Scheduling — Create an automated schedule for the system to automatically
charge your customer (using an Echeck (ACH) or Credit Card transaction) a pre‐determined amount on
a pre‐determined schedule. The system provide two types of recurring payment schedules.
• Recurring Billing Schedule — A schedule that charges a customer a pre‐determined amount on
the frequency defined by the schedule.
• Payment Plan Schedule — A schedule based on a total amount due, for which you program a
specific number of payments. The system charges your customer on the frequency set, and keeps
track of the customer’s payments until the total amount is collected.
• Invoicing — Send an invoice to your customer that contains a button that seamlessly transfers the
customer to a secure online payment form from which he can make a payment.  The system supports
two types of invoice:
• One‐time Invoices — Invoices that get e‐mailed to your customer once.
• Invoice Schedules — Invoices that get e‐mailed to your customer automatically by the system, on
the schedule you set.
• Reporting — Use standard and custom reports to monitor deposits, outstanding and paid invoices, and
successful and failed transactions.
• Online Payments — Use securely hosted ADP Payments Web Payment Pages branded for your
company to accept payments online from links in your website, invoices, or other emails.

Chapter 2: Getting Started 3
Chapter 2:   Getting Started
The following sections walk you through what you’ll need to know and do to get started using ADP Payments. When
your account is first approved and enabled, you’ll login and activate your Master Administrator User account. If
you’re planning to send invoices, first configure the basic invoice settings to customize the system for your business
and enter your terms and conditions.
The Quick Start Guides at the end of the section will help you quickly begin collecting payments and sending
invoices.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Logging In for the First Time 4
Logging In for the First Time
The very first time you login to ADP Payments you will be asked to create a new password. This section covers how
to do this and provides detailed requirements for both User IDs and passwords in ADP Payments. Additionally, the
section provides information about User session time‐outs, and the Master Administrator User that is created when
your ADP Payments account is enabled.
ABOUT USER IDS AND PASSWORDS
When your ADP Payments account is first enabled, you will receive an email providing your User ID and a second
email providing a temporary password. When you (or any other Users) login for the first time, you will immediately
be asked to create a new password. The User ID assigned to you cannot be changed.
Additionally, each time you create a new User in your ADP Payments account, the new User will receive one email
providing the User ID and a second email containing a temporary password, and will need to change the password
upon first login. (See Add Users in Chapter 8.)
Master Administrator Users will have created a Security Question during the Simple Sign‐up® process. All other users
will be prompted to create a Security Question upon first log‐in.
User ID Requirements
Once a ADP Payments User ID is defined, it cannot be changed. For the Master Administrator User the User ID will
always be set to that person’s email address. For other Users, you can choose any User ID you like, provided it meets
the User ID requirements outlined below. So, when assigning a User ID to others in your organization, be certain to
ask them in advance to select something they will like and can remember.
User IDs must contain between 6 and 30 characters, all of which must be numbers, letters, periods, underscores or
@ signs. For example, “janesmith” or “bob_27” or “you@yourcompany.com” or “g0br0wns” are all acceptable, but
“sam” and “me&my#1fan!” are not. User IDs must be unique in the entire ADP Payments system, so keep that in
mind when creating them.
If you ever forget your User ID, you can ask any User on your account with the Administrator role to look it up for
you. You can also call our Customer Care team at 800‐297‐5341 and we can retrieve it for you.
Password Requirements
The first time any User logs into ADP Payments they will be asked to change the temporary password provided when
the User account was enabled. Additionally, every time a password is reset via email, a temporary one‐time use
password will be issued which must also be changed.
Passwords expire every 90 days. ADP Payments keeps track of when you last changed your password, and will
prompt you to enter a new one when the old one expires. You cannot re‐use the same password for 5 password
cycles. When you enter a new password, ADP Payments validates that it has not been used within that time frame.
ADP Payments Password Specifications
• Case sensitive.
• Must be at least 8 characters (special characters are permitted).
• Must include at least one lowercase letter.
• Must include at least one capital letter.
• Must include at least one number.
• Cannot contain your User ID.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Logging In for the First Time 5
For example, “P4ssw0rd” and “S1lly_me!” and “goHOKIES1” and “Bob&Lisa4ever” are all acceptable passwords, but
“password” and “A1b!” and “11111111” and “SAVEME!!” are not.
You can change your password at any time (see How to Reset Your Password)‐‐ We encourage you to do this
immediately if you think it has been compromised.
Your First Login
Every new User receives two emails, the first provides their User ID and the second provides a temporary password.
You will need both of these when you first login to ADP Payments to activate your User account. To do this:
1. Go to the ADP Payments login page, shown below
(https://adp.paysimple.com/signon):   
2. Enter your User ID from the email in the User ID field.
NOTE: If you want your browser to automatically save your User ID, check the “Remember my user ID” box.
If you are accessing ADP Payments from a shared or public computer, it is strongly recommended that you
leave this box unchecked.
3. Enter the temporary password from the email in the Password field.
4. Click the “log in” button.
5. The Change Password screen appears, as shown below:
Each time your password is reset, regardless of method, an email will be sent to the
address on record for the User ID.
If you receive this email and you did not reset your password, please contact ADP
Payments Customer Care immediately at 800‐297‐5341, as it is possible that your
account has been compromised.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Logging In for the First Time 6
6. Enter the temporary password from the email in the Temporary Password field.
7. Enter your new password, making sure it adheres to Password Requirements, in the New Password field.
8. Re‐type the new password in the Confirm New Password field.
9. Click the “change password” button.
10. If there are any errors with the password (for example, if both new password entries don’t match) you will
see an on‐screen error message asking you to correct the problem. Otherwise, you’ll see a pop‐up success
message as shown below:
11. Click the “ok” button to login to your ADP Payments account.
12. At this point you will be asked to set a Security Question. (See Setting Your Security Question for details.)
NOTE: The Master Administrator will skip this step as their Security Question was set during the Simple
Sign‐up® process.
13. The next time you login to ADP Payments, use the new password you just set.
Setting Your Security Question
The Security Question is used to enable Users to directly re‐set a forgotten password from the Log‐in screen. (See
How to Reset Your Password for detailed instructions on how to use the Security Question as part of the password
reset process.)
All Users, except for the Master Administrator User, will be prompted to set a Security Question upon first log‐in.
(The Master Administrator sets the Security Question during the Simple Sign‐up® process.) The prompt will appear
and you are required to set a Security Question to continue. Follow the steps below to set the Security Question.
1. The Security Question screen opens after you have successfully set a new password as part of your first
login.
2. Select a question from the Security Question drop‐down box.
3. Type your answer to the question in the Security Answer field.
NOTE: The answer is not case sensitive.
4. Click the “continue” button to record your question and answer.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Logging In for the First Time 7
5. If there is an error you will see it displayed in red. Otherwise you will be taken to your ADP Payments
Dashboard.
You can change your Security Question as often as you like from the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Account Access
screen. (See Managing Your Security Question in Chapter 8 for instructions on how to do this.) If you believe it has
been compromised, it is very important that you change it, and that you change your password, immediately.
How to Reset Your Password
You can easily reset your own password from the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Account Access screen while logged
in to ADP Payments. If you forget your password, you can re‐set it from the log‐in screen using your Security
Question. (See Setting Your Security Question for instructions.)
It is important that you re‐set your own password if you have forgotten it. After 5 unsuccessful attempts to log‐in to
ADP Payments your account will be locked, and you will need to have an Administrator for your account re‐set it.
Master Administrator users who get locked out will need to contact ADP Payments Customer Care to unlock the
account.
Resetting Your Password from the Account Access Screen
1. Click the “Settings” link in top‐navigation.
NOTE: For users assigned the standard User role, or assigned any custom role that does not provide access
to the Settings center, an “Account Access” link will be placed in top‐navigation. Clicking this link opens the
Account Access screen.
2. Click the “Configuration” tab.
3. Click the “account access” link in the ADDITIONAL OPTIONS section at the bottom of the page.
For users assigned the standard User role, or assigned any custom role that does not
provide access to the Settings center, an “Account Access” link will be placed in top‐
navigation. Clicking this link opens the Account Access screen
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Logging In for the First Time 8
4. Go to the Change password section at the bottom of the screen.
5. Enter your current password in the Old Password field.

NOTE: If you receive this email and you HAVE NOT just re‐set your password, please contact ADP Payments
Customer Care immediately at 800‐297‐5341. It is possible that your account has been compromised.
You can change your password as often as you like. If you believe it has been compromised, be sure to re‐set it
immediately. It is also a good idea to re‐set your Security Question if you believe your password has been
compromised.
Resetting a Forgotten Password
You will need to know your User ID and the exact First Name and Last Name for your User in order to re‐set your own
password. If you do not know this information, ask any Administrator User on your account to look‐up this
information for you. You can also contact ADP Payments Customer Care for assistance.
Follow the steps below to re‐set a forgotten password:
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Logging In for the First Time 9
1. Click the “forgot password?” link from the Log In screen, as shown:
2. The reset qualification page appears. Enter your User ID, First Name and Last Name exactly as they are
saved for your User Record. Then, click the “submit” button.
NOTE: If there is an error with any of the fields, the system will display an error message at the top of the
screen. You will not be able to proceed unless the values entered in these fields exactly match those stored
in the system. (The fields are not case‐sensitive.).
3. Your chosen security question will be shown at the top of the next screen. Enter your answer in the
Security answer field. Click the “submit” button.
NOTE: If there is an error the system will display an error message at the top of the screen. You will not be
able to proceed unless the Security answer you entered exactly matches what is stored in the system. (The
field is not case‐sensitive.)   
4. You are now prompted to create a new password. Enter the new password in the Password field, then type
it again in the Confirm password field. Then click the “log‐in” button.
NOTE: Remember that passwords must be at least 8 characters; contain at least one capital letter, one
lowercase letter, and one number; cannot contain your User ID; and cannot be repeated for 5 password
cycles. If you enter an invalid password, the system will display an error.    
5. Your new password is saved. Use the new password you just created the next time you log‐in.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Logging In for the First Time 10
6. You will receive an email confirming your password has been reset. You do not need to do anything further.
NOTE: If you receive this email and you HAVE NOT just re‐set your password, please contact ADP Payments
Customer Care immediately at 800‐297‐5341. It is possible that your account has been compromised.
ABOUT USER SESSIONS AND TIMEOUTS
There are no limits on how long you can remain logged into ADP Payments so long as you are actively using the
system. After 15 minutes of inactivity you will be logged‐out for security reasons.
When the system logs you out for inactivity, you will continue to see the ADP Payments application in your browser,
and it will appear to be functioning normally. However, when you take an action (click a link, perform a search,
attempt to view a different screen, etc.) you will be returned to the login screen.
When this happens, simply enter your User ID and password to login again. ADP Payments will remember what you
were doing, and log you back into the system right where you left off‐‐ No need to start from scratch!
THE MASTER ADMINISTRATOR
The User generated when your ADP Payments account is configured is the Master Administrator. This User can then
add additional Users to the system and assign permissions and processing limits as required. (See Roles and Users in
Chapter 8 for instruction on how to perform these tasks.)
The primary differences between the Master Administrator User and other Users are as follows:
• The Master Administrator User is created automatically by the system with the “Administrator” role,
which cannot be changed.
• The User ID created for the Master Administrator User is always that person’s email address.
NOTE: You can request a change to this User ID by contacting ADP Payments Customer Care.
• The Master Administrator’s Security Question is set during the Simple Sign‐up® process. It can be
changed at any time from the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Account Access screen.
• The Master Administrator User CANNOT be edited by other users.
• The Master Administrator User cannot be deleted.
• If the Master Administrator User gets locked‐out (due to excessive failed logins), only ADP Payments
Customer Care can unlock the account.
If you are unable to re‐set a forgotten password yourself, either because you have not
yet set a Security Question, or if your account is locked‐out, it can still be reset with a
password change email.
For locked‐out accounts, any Master Administrator User can reset the password using
the “reset password” link from the Edit User screen. (See Reset Passwords for Users in
Chapter 8 for instructions.)
For users who have not set security questions, clicking the “Forgot password?” link on
the log‐in screen will result in an email being sent with a temporary password. Use the
temporary password to log‐in once and set a personal password. Once this is done, the
User will be immediately prompted to set a Security Question.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Getting to Know Your System 11
Getting to Know Your System
The first time Master Administrator Users login to ADP Payments they will be greeted with the Getting Started
Dashboard, shown below.        
The Getting Started Dashboard provides information about adding customers, collecting payments and sending
invoices.
You will continue to see this screen when you (or any other user) login to ADP Payments, and each time you click the
“Dashboard” button in side navigation, until you take at least one of the following actions:
• Add a Customer
• Collect a payment‐‐ view quick start.
• Send an invoice‐‐ view quick start.
After one of the above actions is performed you, and all other ADP Payments users on your account, will see the
standard ADP Payments Dashboard upon logging in.
Additionally, each of the main functional centers‐‐ Payments, Invoices, and Customers‐‐ will also initially display a
Getting Started screen each time their navigation button is selected from side navigation. These screens provide
instructional guides, videos and resources specific to the center that will help you get up and running quickly. The
Getting Started page will disappear once you take an action in the center.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Configuring Your System for Sending Invoices 12
Configuring Your System for Sending Invoices
If you plan to use ADP Payments for electronic invoicing, it is a good idea to customize the system for your business
prior to adding customers and sending invoices.
(If you only plan to use the payment processing functions, skip this section and go directly to the Quick Guides that
show you how to Import Your Customer Database and to Collect a Payment for a New Customer.)
Primary invoice settings that should be addressed now include uploading your logo, setting your invoice numbering
scheme, reviewing the contact information that will appear on invoices and receipts, entering terms and conditions
of sale, and entering tax rates and payment terms for your invoices.
The following sections provide quick‐start configuration tips. For a detailed discussion of all the configuration
settings and customizations you can make to your ADP Payments account, see System Configuration in Chapter 8.
CUSTOMIZE YOUR INVOICE PREFERENCES
Invoice preferences consist of your logo, your invoice numbering scheme, the contact information you want to
appear on invoices, and a default note that appears on all invoices. These are all configured from the preferences
screen accessed from the Configuration tab in the ADP Payments Settings center. (See Preferences in Chapter 8 for a
detailed explanation of the options available in this section.)
To access the preferences screen, click the “Settings” link in top navigation, then click the configuration tab:
On the configuration screen, click the “preferences” link in the PAYMENT OPTIONS section.
The following sections walk you through the configuration options available on the preferences screen. Remember
to click the “save” button at the bottom of the preferences screen to save the changes you make in each section.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Configuring Your System for Sending Invoices 13
Upload Your Logo
Your logo will appear on the PDF invoice sent to your customers, and on all online views of the invoice. Your logo will
also appear on the login page your customers use to pay invoices online, and on the login page for your Customer
Portal. (See Appendix E: Customer Portal.) While uploading a logo is not required, it is an excellent way to reinforce
your brand on the invoices ADP Payments sends to your customers.
NOTE: Your logo file must be in JPG, GIF, or PNG format, and must be no more than 150 KB in size. The system will
resize your logo so that it fits in the allotted space on invoices.
Follow the steps below to upload your logo:
1. Click the “Settings” link in top navigation, then click the Configuration tab.
2. On the configuration screen, click the “preferences” link in the PAYMENT OPTIONS section.
3. At the top of the preferences screen in the “Upload your company logo” section, click the “Choose File”
button to locate your logo file on your hard drive and select it.
Click the “upload” button to upload the logo image to ADP Payments. When your logo is successfully uploaded the
file name will appear to the right of the button, as shown here:   
NOTE: Be sure to click the “save” button at the bottom of the preferences screen to save the logo you uploaded.
Configure Invoice Numbering
You can use auto‐invoice numbering for your ADP Payments invoices, or you can manually enter invoice numbers for
each individual invoice. If you turn auto‐invoice numbering on, you can designate the starting number for auto‐
generated invoices.
To configure auto‐invoice numbering, go to the Invoice preferences section on the preferences screen (this is the
second section on the page.) Enter the starting number for auto‐generated invoice numbers in your system in the
Next invoice number field. You can enter any number between 00001 and 999999999. The system displays 5 digits
of the invoice number by default, and will increase to 12 digits as necessary.
NOTE: 999999999 is the highest invoice number available. The system will return to “00001” after invoice#
“999999999” is sent.
NOTE: Auto‐invoice numbering accepts only numerical invoice numbers‐‐ alpha numeric numbering schemes such
as “AA123” are not supported. However, you can use alpha‐numeric invoice numbers if you enter them manually.
NOTE: Be sure to click the “save” button at the bottom of the preferences screen to save your invoice numbering
settings.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Configuring Your System for Sending Invoices 14
Review Invoice Contact Information
The third section on the preferences screen is Contact information. Use this section to select the contact numbers
you want to include on invoices and receipts. You can select any combination of Phone, Alternate Phone, Fax, Email,
Address and Website.   To include an item, select its checkbox. To remove an item, uncheck its box.
You can add or edit any of the values by clicking the “edit” link next to the Contact information header.   This opens
the update your contact information screen, shown below:   
You can make changes to any field. Click the “save” button to save your changes, or click “cancel” to discard them.
NOTE: To change your Address information or your company name, you need to submit the address/name change
form which can be obtained by contacting customer care at 800‐297‐5341 or
ADPPaymentsSupport@paysimple.com.
NOTE: Be sure to click the “save” button at the bottom of the preferences screen to save any changes you made to
the checkboxes in the Contact information section. You do not need to click the “save” button at the bottom of the
screen if all you changed were items in the update your contact information screen.
You will always have the option to edit an auto‐generated invoice number on one‐time
invoices. If you do this, for example if you change an automated invoice number of
“00999” to “00999A” the system will use the original automated number on your next
invoice.
If you do not want to use auto‐numbering for invoices, enter “00000” in the Next
Invoice number field. If you do this, you will always have to manually enter an invoice
number for one‐time invoices.
If you disable auto‐numbering, the system will assign an invoice number using the
format of “RECURS‐‐Schedule ID‐‐System Invoice ID.” for all recurring invoices.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Configuring Your System for Sending Invoices 15
Set Default Invoice Note
Each invoice contains a Note for customer field. This field enables you to enter a short message on each invoice.   To
save time if you often use the same or a similar message, the default note text you configure on this screen will be
automatically placed in the Note for customer field on every new invoice. You will have the option to change or
delete it each time you enter a new invoice or invoice schedule.
Enter your default note text in the Default invoice note visible to customer section.(2000 character maximum.)
NOTE: Be sure to click the “save” button at the bottom of the preferences screen to save any changes you made to
the Note.
SET INVOICE PAYMENT TERMS AND TAX RATES
When creating invoices and invoice schedules you will need to enter payment terms that are used to determine the
invoice due date. You can also include one or two taxes on each line item in your invoice.
You can enter payment terms while creating invoices or select a specific Due Date instead of using pre‐defined
terms. For invoice schedules, you can define payment terms while entering the schedule. Taxes can be entered while
entering invoices or invoice schedules, or you can opt not to use them at all. However, the Settings‐‐>
Configuration‐‐>Terms and Taxes screen is the only place where payment terms and taxes can be edited or deleted.
The following sections provide quick‐start instructions for setting Payment Terms and Tax rates. See Terms & Taxes in
Chapter 8 for detailed instructions for both these features.
Entering Payment Terms
The settings in the PAYMENT TERMS section of the save payment terms and taxes screen provide short‐cuts for use
while creating invoices. However, you can always enter payment terms and taxes while entering individual invoices
and invoice schedules. For one‐time invoices, you can also select an exact due date, instead of selecting a pre‐
defined payment term.   (See New Invoices and Invoice Schedules in Chapter 5 for more information on creating
invoices.)
Follow the steps below to enter new payment terms.
Click the “Settings” link in top navigation, then click the configuration tab, as shown below:
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Configuring Your System for Sending Invoices 16
1. On the configuration screen, click the “terms & taxes” link in the PAYMENT OPTIONS section.

4. You will now see a new row in the PAYMENT TERMS table. In the first field enter
a description of this payment term, for your own use‐‐ It will not be displayed
on invoices or payment forms.
5. In the payment due drop‐down box, select the payment terms. You can choose
one of the pre‐programmed values of: “On Receipt,” “In 15 days,” “In 30 days,”
or “In 60 days.” To enter a custom value, select the last radio button and enter the custom number of days
in the field, as shown, right.

6. Repeat steps 4‐6 to add additional payment terms. An example of the screen with two payment term
entries is shown below:
7. Click the “save” button at the bottom of the screen to save your changes.
Entering Tax Rates
ADP Payments enables you to include taxes in your invoices. You can apply one or two taxesto each Line Item in your
invoices. You can add new taxes from the send new invoice screen, however Tax rates cannot be edited, or deleted
while creating invoices. They can only be managed from the terms & taxes section of the Settings‐‐> Configuration
screen. Tax Rates will be included in the Tax1 and Tax 2 drop‐down boxes on the send new invoice screen regardless
of the screen on which they are created. (See Chapter 5: Invoices for more information on creating invoices.)
Follow the steps below to enter tax rates:
Click the “Settings” link in top navigation, then click the configuration tab, as shown below:

7. Click the “save” button at the bottom of the screen to save your changes.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Configuring Your System for Sending Invoices 19
INVOICE TERMS OF SALE
Terms of Sale are required on all online invoice payment forms. To get you up and running quickly, your account is
configured with generic Terms of Sale text that meets ACH and Credit Card processing requirements. (See Appendix
A: Authorizing Transactions for detailed information on required language.)
NOTE: These Terms of Sale apply only to your invoices‐‐ they do not apply to Web Payment Pages. When creating
Web Payment Pages you enter a separate set of Terms of Sale for each payment form. (See Web Payment Pages in
Chapter 8 for detailed information.)
Follow the steps below to review and edit invoice Terms of Sale:
1. Click the “Settings” link in top navigation, then click the configuration tab, as shown below:
2. On the configuration screen, click the “invoice settings” link in the PAYMENT OPTIONS section.
3. The Select Invoice Settings Options screen opens.   
It is strongly recommended that you review these Terms of Sale prior to sending
invoices, and that you customize them for your business.
Remember, you will be bound by the Terms of Sale in place when your customers make
online payments.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Configuring Your System for Sending Invoices 20
4. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to the Enter your Terms of Sale here section.
5. Review the generic terms of sale, and make any appropriate changes. For example, you may want to
change “I authorize the company named on this form” to “I authorize {Sample Company}” where “Sample
Company” is the name of your business.
You can enter as much text as you like in this field, so you can make Terms of Sale as comprehensive as
necessary.
NOTE: As these Terms of Sale will appear on the online invoice form used to collect a payment from your
customers, it is important that they meet all requirements for online Credit Card and ACH payments. See
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions for more information on required language.
6. Click the “save” button at the bottom of the screen to save your changes.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Quick Start Guides 21
Quick Start Guides
The following quick start guides walk you through the basics of collecting payments and invoices, and importing your
customer database. In‐depth coverage of payment collection, invoicing and customer management can be found in
those chapters of the help system.
IMPORT YOUR CUSTOMER DATABASE
The import function is a great way to quickly and easily import your customers from any external system into ADP
Payments.
Follow the steps below to import a customer batch.
1. Click “Customers” from side navigation.
2. At the top of the Customers screen click the “import” link, as shown below:
3. The Import Center dashboard appears, as shown below:
4. From the top section select “Customers” as the Import type.
Currently ADP Paymentssupports only U.S. and Canadian addresses. You cannot import
customers with addresses in any other country.
Be sure to prepare your import batch file properly.   See Appendix C: Import
Requirements for detailed requirements and field parameters for Customer import
batches.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Quick Start Guides 22
5. Enter a short descriptive name for your import in the Import name field. This name will be used when
referencing this particular upload batch in tables on the Import Center dashboard.
6. Enter a short description of the upload in the Import description field.
7. In the File type drop‐down box select the type of file you will be importing. You can use a .csv file
(recommended) or a pipe‐delimited text file.
NOTE: To convert an Excel file to .csv, simply use the “save as” command and select .csv as the file type.
8. If the file you are importing contains a header row, check the First row is header checkbox. (Using a header
row is very helpful for the field mapping that you will perform in Step 12.)   If there is no header row, leave
this box unchecked.
9. Click the “Choose File” button to locate the import batch file on your computer.
10. Click the “upload” button to begin the import process.
11. The system will perform a preliminary validation of your file. If it is corrupt or unusable, you will see an
error message. Otherwise, you will see the Map Field Titles screen, shown below:
• The first column displays the values in the first row of each column in your file. These will either be the
values in your header row, or the first row of data (if your file does not contain a header row).
• The second column contains drop‐down boxes used to map a field in your file to a system field.
• The Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box enables you to select a saved mapping schema. (See
About Saved Mapping Schemes in Chapter 8 for instructions on using saved mappings.)
• The “reset mapping” button will clear all values in the System Field Names drop‐down boxes so that
you can begin the mapping process again.
• The help box, located under the “reset mapping” button provides definitions for all of the ADP
Payments system fields. Select a field name from the drop‐down, and its definition will appear under
the box.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Quick Start Guides 23
12. For each column you want to map from your file, select a corresponding ADP Payments field from the
associated drop‐down box, as shown below. If you do not want to map a field from your file, leave the
corresponding drop‐down box set to “‐Select Column‐.”
NOTE: As you select fields they disappear from the list of available fields‐‐ This prevents you from
accidentally creating duplicate mappings.   
• The following fields are required for a Customer import batch (you must supply mappings for them).
• First Name
• Last Name
• Billing Address 1
• City
• State/Province
• Zip/Postal Code
NOTE: If the Country field is not included, or is left blank, it will default to “USA.”
13. When you have finished mapping fields, click the “continue” button.
14. On the next screen, shown below, enter a name for the mapping you just created in the Mapping Name
field. You can select this mapping at a later date from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box to quickly
map a file using the same column structure.
NOTE: You are required to save your mapping. Even if you never expect to use it again, storing it will save
time if there is an error and you need to upload your file again.
15. Enter a Description for the mapping. (Optional)
16. Click the “save and continue” button.
Chapter 2: Getting Started : Quick Start Guides 24
17. The Approve File Import For Processing screen appears, as shown below:
• The top line (in white) contains the ADP Payments system field names, in alphabetical order.
• The second line (in purple) appears only if your file has a header row, and contains the field names in
that header row.
• The following 5 lines (in white) contain the first 5 data rows from your file. You can scroll through them
in the table.
18. Double check that your mapping correctly matched fields in your file to ADP Payments system fields.
  a. If you see an error, click the “back to mapping” button to return to the mapping screen (Step 12.),
correct any errors, and proceed.
  b. When you’re satisfied with the mapping, click the “approve batch” button.
19. When the file is successfully uploaded and queued for processing, you’ll see an on‐screen success message
as shown below. (If there are errors you’ll see an on‐screen message indicating the corrections that need to
be made.)
20. Click the “Import Center” link to return to the Import Center dashboard and view the status of your file.
21. You will see your file in one of the Import Center tables (See Import Center Dashboard in Chapter 8 for
details on this screen.)

The Expiring Credit Cards section lists all active schedules for which the customer's credit card will expire during the
next month. (For example, if you view the Dashboard in June, this list will contain schedules with credit cards
expiring in July.)
NOTE: This table creates one entry per schedule with an expiring credit card, NOT one entry per credit card. Thus, as
in the example below, if you have entered more than one schedule for a customer and both schedules use the same
credit card, both schedules will be in this list. When you update the credit card with a new expiration date, you only
need to do it once in order to update all schedules.
The Exp Date column indicates the month and year in which the credit card will expire.
The first and last name of the customer is dis plated in the Customer column. Clicking the linked customer name
opens the Customer Record in view mode.

table filtered to display the invoices represented.
NOTE: This total includes invoices entered individually and those generated by invoice schedules.
The bars in the graph are color‐coded by invoice status with red for overdue invoices, green for paid invoices and
blue for unpaid invoices. They use the left‐hand axis and represent the total dollar value for each category based on
invoices that are due in the indicated month. Mouse‐over any of the colored bar portions to see the exact amount.
Click any colored portion of the bar to go to the manage invoices screen with the Invoices table filtered to display
the invoices represented.
NOTE: The bar graph values are allocated based on the month in which the invoice is due, NOT the month in which
the invoice was paid. For example, if an invoice was due on April 1, but wasn’t actually paid until May 1, the dollar
amount of the payment will be included in the April bar NOT the May bar.
The orange line indicates the number of invoices sent over the six month period depicted in the chart. Mouse over
the orange dot to see the exact number. Click the orange dot to go to the manage invoices screen with the Invoices
table filtered to display the invoices represented.

screen. Once you have saved your changes to the Customer Record, you will see the customer
information appear in the collect new payment screen.
• Search for a different customer.
• Continue entering the new payment or schedule.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 57
ENTERING ONE-TIME PAYMENTS
One‐time payments are typically used when customers place an order over the phone, or if a written authorization
form is signed providing permission for a single charge on a specific date.  
The basic steps for entering a one‐time payment are simple:
1. Load an existing customer (or enter a new one).
2. Enter the Payment amount.
3. Select the Payment Method.
4. Select the account to debit (or enter a new one).
5. Click the “collect payment” button.
Complete step‐by‐step instructions follow.
1. Navigate to the Payments‐‐> collect new payment screen by clicking the “collect payment” Quick Link in
side navigation.
2. Search for and load an existing customer, or enter a new one. (See Loading and Entering Customers for New
Payments and Schedules above.)
3. In the right‐hand section, shown below, you will always see the three standard fields: Invoice number, P.O.
number, and Payment description.   Additionally, if you have configured any custom fields for payments,
they will appear below the standard fields, as shown:
  a. Standard fields are optional.
  i. Invoice number: Your invoice number for the payment‐‐ This can be any value you like.
(Maximum 50 characters.)
NOTE: If you enter a ADP Payments invoice number in this field, and the number is attached to the
loaded customer, processing the payment will mark the invoice as “Paid” if the payment is for the
full invoice amount, or “Paid (partial)” if the payment is for less than the full amount.
  ii. P.O. number: Your customer's P.O. number for the payment. (Maximum 50 characters.)
  iii. Payment description: Enter any short text description or message. (Maximum 250 characters.)
This description will appear on the Transaction Details screen as well as on receipts.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 58
  b. Custom Payment Details fields are also optional.
  i. You can create custom fields in the following formats: Text, Text Area, Checkbox, DropDown.
  ii. See Custom Fields in Chapter 8 for more information on creating and editing custom fields.
4. Enter the amount you are collecting in the Payment amount field. Enter an amount in the format of 0.00.
Do not include the $‐‐ The system will automatically add that for you.
5. The Payment type field defaults to “One‐time payment.” Leave this default selection as is.
6. The Payment date field will display the current date by default. Leave this default selection as is to process
the payment immediately.
NOTE: See Scheduling One‐Time Payments for a Future Date below for instructions on how to enter a one‐
time payment for a future date.
IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE INVOICE NUMBER FIELD
Though you can use the Invoice number field to link an independent payment to a ADP
Payments Invoice, it is not the ideal process for collecting an invoice payment. (See
Processing Payments for Specific Invoices in Chapter 5 for the best approach.)
If you do use this functionality, be aware of the following limitations:
• The invoice number you enter must be for the exact customer for whom you
are collecting a payment. If the Invoice number is not associated with the
Customer ID, the payment will not be attached to the invoice.
• You must enter the exact invoice number that appears in the Invoices table. For
example, if the invoice table displays “00099” you must enter “00099” in the
Invoice number field, entering “99” will not attach the payment to the invoice.
• Invoice payments made from the collect new payment screen directly do not
include a validation of invoice amount. Thus invoice overpayments and
underpayments are permitted. (For underpayments the invoice will be marked
as “Paid (partial).”)
• Invoice payments made from the collect new payment screen directly do not
respect the system setting for invoice partial payments. Partial payments will
be processed, even if you turned them off in the Settings center.
• When a payment is associated with a system invoice, after clicking the “collect
payment” button you go to the manage invoices screen, not the manage
payments screen. To view the payment itself, and the payment confirmation #,
click the “Payments” button in side navigation. The payment you just processed
should be at the top of the Payments table.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 59
7. Select Credit card or echeck (ACH) in the Choose a Payment Method section.
NOTE: You will only see one option here if your account is configured for only Credit Card or only echeck
(ACH) processing, in which case you will not need to make a selection.
8. Select the credit card or bank account you want to use, or enter a new one.
  a. Credit Card: (See Using Credit Cards for New Payments and Schedules below for detailed instructions.)
  i. If using an existing card, select its radio button in the Use column, ask your customer for the card’s
CVV2 code and enter it in the CVV2 Code field.
NOTE: The default credit card will be automatically selected. (See About Default Payment Accounts in
Chapter 6 for details on setting and changing the default credit card account.)
  ii. If entering a new card, enter values for Card type, Card number, CVV2 Code, and Expiration date
in the fields located under the saved cards table.
NOTE: If you want the new card to be the default account, check the Set as default account box.
  b. echeck (ACH): (See Using Bank Accounts for New Payments and Schedules below for detailed
instructions.)
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 60
  i. In the echeck (ACH) type drop‐down box, select the type of ACH transaction for which you have
obtained authorization. (See Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions for more information on ACH
types.) The following Types are appropriate for one‐time transactions:
• PPD‐‐Written (You have a signed authorization from your customer.)
• TEL‐‐Telephone (Your customer authorized the transaction over the phone.)
• WEB‐‐ Website (Your customer authorized the transaction via a form on the Internet.)
• CCD‐‐ Company (This is a transaction between two companies, and you have an overriding
agreement with the other company for ACH transactions.)
NOTE: Many business checking accounts are not enabled for ACH transactions. Before
entering a CCD transaction, make certain that your customer confirms that the account is
enabled for ACH. If it is not, you may be assessed Return fees and/or Chargeback fees.
  ii. Select a saved bank account to use, or enter a new one.
   1• For a saved account, select the radio button in the Use column for the account you want to charge.
NOTE: The default bank account will be automatically selected. (See About Default Payment Accounts in
Chapter 6 for details on setting and changing the default bank account.)
   2• For a new account, enter the Bank name, Bank routing number, Bank account number, and Account
type in the fields located under the saved accounts table.
NOTE: If you want the new account to be the default, check the Set as default account box.
9. Review the Email Receipt settings for the payment and make any required changes. The settings in this
section are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to
configure receipt settings.)    
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box. (See Email Preferences and Templates in
Chapter 8 for help with editing email templates.)
NOTE: If you are entering an ACH payment, be certain to select the ACH Receipt Type that matches the
ACH Type you selected for the payment. For example, select the “Receipt‐‐ACH Payment‐‐TEL” receipt
if you selected TEL in step 7 above.
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the receipt to that address.
• Enter a different email address in the Send to other field, or add an additional address to the field. You
can enter multiple addresses separated by commas. (Maximum 200 characters)
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a receipt to the customer, the email address(es) entered in the
Send to other field will be the email CC addresses. If the send to customer box is not checked, then
email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 61
10. Review the failed payment notification settings, and make any required changes. The settings in this section
are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐>
Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in
Chapter 8 for details on how to configure failure notification settings.)   
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box. (See Email Preferences and Templates in
Chapter 8 for help with editing email templates.)
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the failure notification to that
email address.
• Enter a different email address in the Send to other field, or add an additional address to the field. You
can enter multiple addresses separated by commas. (Maximum 200 characters)
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a failure notification to the customer, the email address(es)
entered in the Send to other field will be the email CC addresses. If send to customer box is not
checked, then email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
11. Click the “collect payment” button at the bottom right of the screen to submit the payment. Or click the
“cancel” button to discard it.
12. If there are any errors with the transaction, or if it is not authorized, you will see an error message
displayed at the top of the screen as well as a detailed explanation at the point of the problem, as shown
below. You can then make corrections and re‐submit the payment, or discard it.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 62
13. When the payment is authorized, the manage payments screen will appear. There will be a message above
the table verifying that the transaction was successfully entered. The new transaction will be at the top of
the payments table, as shown below.
• The first column will display the payment Status.
• For Credit Card the Status will be “Authorized.”
• For ACH the Status will be “Posted.”
• The Confirm. # column will display the transaction confirmation number, referred to asthe Transaction
ID in reports and on the Transaction Details screen.
At this point, you can view or print transaction details by clicking the Confirm. # link or selecting “View transaction
details” from the Action menu. You can also void the transaction by selecting “Void” from the Action menu. (See
Viewing Transaction Details, Printing Payment Details, and Voiding Transactions for detailed instructions on
performing these tasks.)
SCHEDULING ONE-TIME PAYMENTS FOR A FUTURE DATE
One‐time payments can be entered in ADP Payments for processing on a future date. If you do this, be certain that
your customer has properly authorized the payment for processing on that date. (See Appendix A: Authorizing
Transactions for more information on proper payment authorizations.)
One‐time payments scheduled for a future date function as a hybrid of one‐time payments and recurring payment
schedules. They are entered using the “One‐time payment” Payment type, but use the receipt and notification
settings for recurring billing payment schedules.
Follow the detailed steps below to enter a one‐time payment for a future date:
1. Navigate to the Payments‐‐>collect new payment screen by clicking the “collect payment” Quick Link in
side navigation.
2. Search for and load an existing customer, or enter a new one. (See Loading and Entering Customers for New
Payments and Schedules above.)
One‐time payments entered for a future date will be saved in the Recurring Payments
table. Once the payment date isreached and the payment is processed, it will appear in
the Payments table.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 63
3. In the right‐hand Payment Details section, shown below, you will always see the three standard fields:
Invoice number, P.O. number, and Payment description.   Additionally, if you have configured any custom
fields for payments, they will appear below the standard fields, as shown:
  a. Standard Payment Details fields are optional.
  i. Invoice number: Your invoice number for the payment‐‐ This can be any value you like.
(Maximum 50 characters.)
NOTE: If you enter a ADP Payments invoice number in this field, and the number is attached to the
loaded customer, the invoice will be marked as “Paid” once the scheduled payment is actually
processed (on the Payment date) if the payment is for the full invoice amount, or “Paid (partial)” if
the payment is for less than the full amount.
  ii. P.O. number: Your customer's P.O. number for the payment. (Maximum 50 characters.)
  iii. Payment description: Enter any short text description or message. (Maximum 250 characters.)
This description will appear on the Transaction Details screen as well as on receipts.
IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE INVOICE NUMBER FIELD
Though you can use the Invoice number field to link an independent one‐time future
payment to a ADP Payments Invoice, it’s not the ideal process for collecting an invoice
payment. (See Processing Payments for Specific Invoices in Chapter 5 for the best
approach.)
If you do use this functionality, be aware of the following limitations:
• The invoice number you enter must be for the exact customer for whom you
are collecting a payment. If the Invoice number is not associated with the
Customer ID, the payment will not be attached to the invoice.
• You must enter the exact invoice number that appears in the Invoices table. For
example, if the invoice table displays “00099” you must enter “00099” in the
Invoice number field, entering “99” will not attach the payment to the invoice.
• Invoice payments made from the collect new payment screen directly do not
include a validation of invoice amount. Thus invoice overpayments and
underpayments are permitted. (For underpayments the invoice will be marked
as “Paid (partial).”)
• Invoice payments made from the collect new payment screen directly do not
respect the system setting for invoice partial payments. Partial payments will
be processed, even if you turned them off in the Settings center.
• The invoice status will be updated once the scheduled payment is successfully
processed. If the scheduled payment fails, the invoice status will not change.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 64
  b. Custom Payment Details fields are not saved if the payment is entered for a future date. It looks like
the field values save, but they do not.
NOTE: The values do not save because one‐time payments for a future date are actually one‐payment
schedules, and custom fields are not supported for recurring payment schedules.
4. Enter the amount you are collecting in the Payment amount field. Enter an amount in the format of 0.00.
Do not include the $‐‐ The system will automatically add that for you.
5. The Payment type field defaults to “One‐time payment.” Leave this default selection as is.
6. The Payment date field will display the current date by default. Place your cursor in the field to open the
calendar, and click on the date on which you want the payment to be processed.
7. Select Credit card or Echeck (ACH) in the CHOOSE A PAYMENT METHOD section.
NOTE: You will only see one option here if your account is configured for only Credit Card or only Echeck
(ACH) processing, in which case you will not need to make a selection.
8. Select the credit card or bank account you want to use, or enter a new one.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 65
  a. Credit Card: (See Using Credit Cards for New Payments and Schedules below for detailed instructions.)
  i. If using an existing card, select its radio button in the Use column, ask your customer for the card’s
CVV2 code and enter it in the CVV2 Code field.
NOTE: The default credit card will be automatically selected. (See About Default Payment Accounts in

instructions.)
  i. In the echeck (ACH) type drop‐down box, select the type of ACH transaction for which you have
obtained authorization. (See Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions for more information on ACH
types.) The following Types are appropriate for one‐time transactions:
• PPD‐‐Written (You have a signed authorization from your customer.)
• TEL‐‐Telephone (Your customer authorized the transaction over the phone.)
• WEB‐‐ Website (Your customer authorized the transaction via a form on the Internet.)

   2• For a new account, enter the Bank name, Bank routing number, Bank account number, and Account
type in the fields located under the saved accounts table.
NOTE: If you want the new account to be the default, check the Set as default account box.
9. Review the Email Receipt settings for the payment and make any required changes. The settings in this
section are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you created in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐>
Email Preferences and Templates screen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on
how to configure receipt settings.)    
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box. (See Email Preferences and Templates in
Chapter 8 for help with editing email templates.) The “Receipt‐‐Scheduled Payment” is the default
receipt for one‐time payments scheduled for a future date. It is a generic receipt not specifically
tailored to a single scheduled payment.
• An alternate choice in the Send payment receipt drop‐down box is the “Receipt‐‐ Scheduled One‐
time Payment” email template. This template is specifically tailored to a one‐time payment for a
future date. It provides the payment date and amount, and makes clear that only a single payment
has been scheduled.
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the receipt to that email
address.
• Enter a different email address in the Send to other field, or add an additional address to the field. You
can enter multiple addresses separated by commas. (Maximum 200 characters)
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a receipt to the customer, the email address(es) entered in the
Send to other field will be the email CC addresses. If send to customer box is not checked, then email
addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 67
10. Review the failed payment notification settings, and make any required changes. The settings in this section
are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you created in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to
configure failure notification settings.)   
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box. (See Email Preferences and Templates in
Chapter 8 for help with editing email templates.)
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the failure notification to that
email address.
• Enter a different email address in the Send to other field, or add an additional address to the field. You
can enter multiple addresses separated by commas. (Maximum 200 characters)
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a failure notification to the customer, the email address(es)
entered in the Send to other field will be the email CC addresses. If send to customer box is not
checked, then email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
11. Review the Pre‐Notification Email settings. The settings in this section are based on the Receipt and
Notification settings you set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen.
(See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to configure pre‐notification
settings.)
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Un‐check the Send schedule notification box if you don’t want to send the pre‐notification email.
NOTE: The pre‐notification email is always sent to the customer’s primary email address.
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box. (See Email Preferences and Templates in
Chapter 8 for help with editing email templates.)
• Select a different number of Days Prior to the pre‐notification email. You can select any number of
days from 1 through 10.
CALCULATING PRE‐NOTIFICATION EMAIL DATE
The pre‐notification email is sent based on the Days Prior setting you select and the
scheduled payment date. For example, for a payment scheduled for January 8, pre‐
notification emails would be sent as follows:
• 1 Day Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 7
• 5 Days Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 3
• 7 Days Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 1
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 68
12. Click the “collect payment” button at the bottom right of the screen to submit the payment. Or click the
“cancel” button to discard it.
13. If there are any errors with the transaction you will see an error message displayed at the top of the screen
as well as a detailed explanation at the point of the problem.  You can then make corrections and re‐submit
the payment, or discard it.
14. When the payment is saved, the manage recurring payments screen will appear. There will be a message
above the table verifying that the payment wassuccessfully saved. The new transaction will be at the top of
the Recurring Payments table, as shown below.
• The first column will display the schedule Status as “Active.”
• The Schedule Id column will display the schedule ID assigned to the payment. When the payment is
actually processed, it will be assigned a Transaction ID.
• The Frequency will display as “Annually.”
NOTE: This does not mean that the payment will be processed each year. The schedule End date is
configured to be the day after the payment is processed. This will set the schedule Status to “Expired”
on the End date, and it will not generate any further payments.
• The Start date and Next payment date will both be the date you selected to process the payment, and
it will be processed on that date.
• The End date will be the day after the Start date.
NOTE: This ensures that only the one schedule payment is generated. After that payment is processed,
the schedule Status will update to “Expired.”
One‐time payments entered for a future date use the Failure Notification and Pre‐
Notification email templates designed for recurring billing schedules.
If you want to customize these emails to remove schedule fields, edit the following
email templates:
Failure Notification Email: “Failure Notice‐‐Recurring Billing‐‐Primary”
Pre‐Notification Email: “Pre‐Notification‐‐Bill Payment”
See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for help with editing email
templates.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 69
When you enter a one‐time payment for a future date, the system creates a recurring billing schedule for one
payment in the amount you entered, which is why you see it in the Recurring Payments table instead of the
Payments table. The actions you can take once the payment is saved are the same as those available for all other
recurring billing schedules.
You can view the scheduled payment details by clicking the linked Schedule Id or by selecting Edit in the Action
menu. You can suspend the payment‐‐so that it will not be processed‐‐by selecting “Suspend” from the Action
menu. Select “Resume” from the Action menu to process the payment.
Once the payment is processed, you will see it in the Payments table. Additionally, when you view the scheduled
payment, by clicking its linked Schedule Id, you will see the processed payment in the COLLECTED PAYMENTS table.
ENTERING ONE-TIME STANDALONE CREDITS
One‐time credits are available for credit cards only. They are typically used when you want to issue a partial credit to
a customer or if you want to refund multiple credit card payments with a single credit transaction. If you want to
refund a single payment in its entirety, use the Refund function instead. (See Refunding Payments for instructions on
how to do this.)   
Follow the detailed instructions below to enter a standalone credit.
1. Navigate to the Payments‐‐> collect new payment screen by clicking the “collect payment” Quick Link in
side navigation.
2. Search for and load an existing customer. (See Loading and Entering Customers for New Payments and
Schedules above.)
NOTE: Credit card processing rules state that you can only issue a credit for up to the original payment
amount (s), and that you cannot credit a card for more than you have charged against it. Thus you should
only be using the standalone credit function for existing customers and stored credit cards.
3. In the right‐hand section, shown below, you will always see the three standard fields: Invoice number, P.O.
number, and Payment description.   Additionally, if you have configured any custom fields for payments,
they will appear below the standard fields, as shown. You can enter values in these fields if they apply to
the credit.
NOTE: The Invoice number field CANNOT be used to attach a credit to a ADP Payments system invoice.
Even if a valid Invoice # is entered, the credit will not cause a deduction in the invoice “Balance Due.”
However, the number entered in the field will be displayed in the Invoice # column of the Payments table.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 70
4. Enter the amount you are crediting in the Payment amount field. Enter an amount in the format of 0.00.
Do not include the $‐‐ The system will automatically add that for you.
5. In the Payment type drop‐down box, select “Credit Card Credit.”
6. The Payment date field will display the current date and will not be editable. You can only issue credits for
the current day.
7. The Choose a Payment Method section will display the saved credit cards for the active customer.
8. Click the Use radio button for the card you want to credit. As this is a credit transaction, there is no need to
enter the CVV2 Code.
NOTE: The default credit card will be automatically selected‐‐ Do not assume that the system is indicating
the credit card account you should credit.   (See About Default Payment Accountsin Chapter 6 for details on setting
and changing the default credit card account.)
9. Review the Email Receipt settings for the payment and make any required changes. The settings in this
section are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to
configure receipt settings.)
    
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box. (See Email Preferences and Templates in
Chapter 8 for help with editing email templates.)
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the receipt to that email
address.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 71
• Enter a different email address in the Send to other field, or add an additional address to the field. You
can enter multiple addresses separated by commas. (Maximum 200 characters)
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a receipt to the customer, the email address(es) entered in the
Send to other field will be the email CC addresses. If the send to customer box is not checked, then
email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
10. Notice that the “Send failure notification” box is blank. This is because the system does not send a
notification to your customer if a refund attempt fails. (Refund failures after authorization are extremely
remote occurrences.)
NOTE: Even though the checkboxes are checked no failure email will be sent.    
11. Click the “process credit” button at the bottom right of the screen to submit the credit. Or click the “cancel”
button to discard it.
12. If there are any errors with the transaction you will see an error message displayed at the top of the screen
as well as a detailed explanation at the point of the problem. You can then make corrections and re‐submit
the credit transaction, or discard it.
13. When the credit is authorized, the manage payments screen will appear. There will be a message above the
table verifying that the credit was successfully posted. The new transaction will be at the top of the
payments table, as shown below.
• The first column will display the payment Status as “Refund (Posted).” Once the credit transaction has
been submitted for processing and the funds have been debited from your account the Status will
change to “Refund (Settled).”
• The Confirm. # column will display the transaction confirmation number, referred to asthe Transaction
ID in reports and on the Transaction Details screen.
At this point, you can view or print transaction details by clicking the Confirm. # link or selecting “View transaction
details” from the Action menu. You can also void the transaction by selecting “Void” from the Action menu. (See
Viewing Transaction Details, Printing Payment Details, and Voiding Transactions for detailed instructions on
performing these tasks.)
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 72
ENTERING RECURRING PAYMENT SCHEDULES
ADP Payments supports two kinds of recurring payment schedules:
• Recurring Billing Schedules‐‐ Schedules for a specific payment amount on a specific schedule.  
Recurring Billing schedules can be configured to end on a set date, or to run indefinitely.
• Payment Plan Schedules‐‐ Schedules for a specific number of payments executed on a specific
schedule, to pay a single debt. The schedule terminates once the debt is paid.
The basic steps for entering a recurring payment schedule are simple:
1. Load an existing customer (or enter a new one).
2. Select the schedule type in the Payment type field and enter schedule details.
3. Select the Payment method.
4. Select the account to debit (or enter a new one).
5. Enter receipt and notification options.
6. Click the “collect payment” button to activate the schedule.
The following sections provide detailed instructions for each type of schedule.
Entering Recurring Billing Schedules
Follow the steps below to enter a recurring billing schedule.
1. Navigate to the Payments‐‐> collect new payment screen by the “collect payment” Quick Link in side
navigation.
2. Search for and load an existing customer, or enter a new one. (See Loading and Entering Customers for New
Payments and Schedules above.)
3. In the right‐hand section, shown below, you will always see three standard fields, all of which are optional:
Invoice number, P.O. number, and Payment description.
NOTE: Custom fields are not available for recurring payments. If you enter values in custom fields, they will
be removed when you select “Recurring billing” or “Payment plan” in the Payment type field.
It is critically important that you obtain proper authorization from your customers for
all recurring payment schedules entered in ADP Payments. You must also make it easy
for your customer to find, and understand, any steps they need to take in order to
change, end, or suspend any recurring payment schedules.
For more information about recurring schedule authorizations, and sample
authorization forms you can customize for your company, see Appendix A: Authorizing
Transactions.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 73
  a. Invoice number: Your invoice number for the payment schedule. (This can be any value you like and a
maximum of 50 characters.) The same invoice number will be used for each payment generated by the
schedule.
NOTE: If you enter a ADP Payments invoice number in this field, and the number is attached to the
loaded customer, each payment in the schedule will be attached to the indicated invoice. As the
payments are authorized, a corresponding amount will be deducted from the invoice “Balance Due.”
When the first payment is processed, the invoice status will be changed to “Paid (partial).” When all
payments have been processed at the end of the schedule, the invoice status will change to “Paid.”
  b. P.O. number: Your customer's P.O. number for the payment schedule. (Maximum 50 characters.)
  c. Payment description: Enter any short text description or message. (Maximum 250 characters.) This
description will appear on the Transaction Details screen as well as on schedule confirmation emails
and receipts
.
4. Select “Recurring billing” from the Payment type drop‐down box, as shown below:
IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE INVOICE NUMBER FIELD
You can use the Invoice number field to create a recurring billing schedule to discharge
an invoice. As each scheduled payment is successfully processed, the corresponding
amount will be deducted from the invoice “Balance Due.”
If you use this functionality, be aware of the following limitations:
• The invoice number you enter must be for the exact customer for whom you
are collecting a payment. If the Invoice number is not associated with the
Customer ID, the scheduled payments will not be attached to the invoice.
• You must enter the exact invoice number that appears in the Invoices table. For
example, if the invoice table displays “00099” you must enter “00099” in the
Invoice number field, entering “99” will not attach the schedule to the invoice.
• Invoice payments made via payment schedules do not include a validation of
invoice amount. Thus the system will not prevent you from creating a schedule
that will result in collecting more than the invoice Total Due.
• Custom First Payments made via the schedule will be attached to the
designated invoice, and when they are processed will result in the
corresponding amount being deducted from the invoice “Balance Due.”
• The invoice Status and Balance Due will be updated once the scheduled
payment is successfully processed. If the scheduled payment fails, the invoice
status will not change.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 74
5. The Recurring billing configuration section appears as shown below:
6. In the Payment amount field, enter the amount to be collected.  Enter a number using a format of 0.00.  Do
not include the $‐‐The system will add it for you.
7. In the Billing frequency field, select how often your customer will be billed:
• Daily
• Weekly‐‐ A new drop‐down box will appear in which you should select the day of the week to bill.
• Every‐other‐week‐‐ A new drop‐down box will appear in which you should select the day of the week
to bill.
• First of month
• Specific day of month‐‐ A new drop‐down box will allow you to select the day of the month to bill.
NOTE: If you want to bill on the 30th or the 31st, select the “Last of month” option instead of the
“Specific day of month” option to avoid confusion in short months like February.
• Last of month
• Quarterly‐‐ If you select this option, the system will bill every 3 months on the day of the month used
for the schedule start date.
• Semi‐Annually‐‐If you select this option, the system will bill every 6 months on the day of the month
used for the schedule start date.
• Annually‐‐If you select this option, the system will bill every year on the month and day used for the
schedule start day.
8. Place your cursor in the Start field to open the calendar. Select the day you want the schedule to begin. Use
the arrows to the left and right of the month to scroll through the calendar one month at a time.
NOTE: If you select the current day, and the frequency you selected indicates a payment for the current day,
your customer will be charged for the first payment in the schedule immediately after the schedule is
saved. For example, if you select “February 10, 2010” as your Start date, and your frequency is the 10th of
every month, the payment will be processed when you save the schedule. If your frequency is the 11th of
every month, the first scheduled payment will not be processed until the next day.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 75
   
9. The No end date radio button is selected by default in the End field. With this setting the schedule will run
until you manually suspend it. To enter a specific end date, select the specific end date radio button and
click the field to select an end date from the calendar.
Click the month, year heading at the top of the calendar to get a full year view, as shown above. Advance
years by using the left and right arrows, then click on the month to open the calendar page where you can
select a specific day.   
10. Enter a Custom first payment. (Optional) A custom first payment must occur BEFORE the first payment in
the schedule. Custom first payments are typically for one‐time payments of the same or different amount
from the scheduled amount.   For example, you might use a custom first payment to collect a set‐up fee,
and then use the schedule to collect monthly usage fees.    
To enter a Custom first payment:
  a. Select the  Custom first payment checkbox.
  b. Enter the 1st payment amount.
  c. Place your cursor in the Payment date field, and use the pop‐up calendar to select the date your
customer will be billed.
NOTE: If you select the current day, the payment will be processed when the schedule is saved.

  ii. If entering a new card, enter values for Card type, Card number, CVV2 Code, and Expiration date
in the fields located under the saved cards table.
NOTE: Entering the CVV2 Code is optional. CVV2 validation is used as a security measure to verify
that the customer has the card in hand when authorizing the schedule. It will only be validated if
the first payment on the schedule or the custom first payment will take place on the current day.
The system will NEVER store the CVV2 code, so it cannot be validated on future transactions.
NOTE: If you want the new card to be the default account, check the Set as default account box.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 77
  b. echeck (ACH): (See Using Bank Accounts for New Payments and Schedules below for instructions.)
  i. In the echeck (ACH) type drop‐down box, select the type of ACH transaction for which you have
obtained authorization. (See Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions for more information on ACH
types.) The following Types are appropriate for recurring transactions:
• PPD‐Written (You have a signed authorization from your customer.)
• WEB‐‐ Website (Your customer authorized the transaction via a form on the Internet.)
• CCD‐‐ Company (Thisis a transaction between two companies where you have an overriding
agreement with the other company for ACH transactions.)
NOTE: Many business checking accounts are not enabled for ACH transactions. Before
entering a CCD transaction, make certain that your customer confirms that the account is
enabled for ACH. If it is not, you may be assessed Return fees and/or Chargeback fees.
  ii. Select a saved bank account to use, or enter a new one.
   1• For a saved account, select the radio button in the Use column for the account you want to charge.
NOTE: The default bank account will be automatically selected. (See About Default Payment

section are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to
configure receipt settings.)    
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box. The default template selected is “Receipt‐‐ 
Scheduled Payment.” This is a generic receipt for all scheduled payment types.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 78
• An alternate choice in the Send payment receipt drop‐down box is the “Receipt‐‐ Recurring Billing
Schedule” email template. This template is specifically tailored to receipts for billing schedules. It
contains Schedule ID, Next Payment Date, and information about how to change or cancel schedules.
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the receipt to that email
address.
• Enter a different email address in the Send to other field, or add an additional address to the field. You
can enter multiple addresses separated by commas. (Maximum 200 characters)
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a receipt to the customer, the email address(es) entered in the
Send to other field will be the email CC addresses. If send to customer box is not checked, then email
addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
14. Review the failed payment notification settings, and make any required changes. The settings in this section
are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to
configure receipt settings.)   
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box. (See Email Preferences and Templates in
Chapter 8 for help with editing email templates.)
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the failure notification to that

checked, then email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
15. Review the Pre‐Notification Email settings. The settings in this section are based on the Receipt and
Notification settings set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen. (See
Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to configure pre‐notification settings.)
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Un‐check the Send schedule notification box if you don’t want to send the pre‐notification email.
NOTE: The pre‐notification email is always sent to the customer’s primary email address.
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 79
• Select a different number of Days Prior to the pre‐notification email. You can select any number of
days from 1 through 10.
16. Click the “create recurring payment” button at the bottom right of the screen to save and activate the
schedule. Or click the “cancel” button to discard it. (See System Actions Upon Activating a Recurring

18. When the schedule is saved, the manage recurring payments screen will open. There will be a message
above the table verifying that the schedule was successfully entered. The new schedule will be at the top of
the Recurring Payments table, as shown below:
• The first column will display the schedule Status as “Active.”
• The second column will display the Schedule Id for the schedule.
CALCULATING PRE‐NOTIFICATION EMAIL DATE
The pre‐notification email is sent based on the Days Prior setting you select and the
scheduled payment date. For example, for a payment scheduled for January 8, pre‐
notification emails would be sent as follows:
• 1 Day Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 7
• 3 Days Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 5
• 5 Days Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 3
• 7 Days Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 1

6. Enter the total amount your customer owes in the Total due field.
7. Enter the number of payments in the schedule in the Number of payments field.
NOTE: You can enter between 1 and 99 payments.
8. The system will auto‐calculate the Payment amount for you by dividing the Total due by the Number of
payments (rounding up to the nearest cent), as shown. You cannot type in this field.   
9. In the Billing frequency field, select how often your customer will be billed:
• Daily
• Weekly‐‐ A new drop‐down box will appear in which you should select the day of the week to bill.
• Every‐other‐week‐‐ A new drop‐down box will appear in which you should select the day of the week
to bill.
• First of month
• Specific day of month‐‐‐ A new drop‐down box will appear in which you should select the day of the

every month, the first scheduled payment will not be processed until the next day.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 83
NOTE: There is no end date for a payment plan schedule. The schedule will end when the last payment has
been collected.   
11. Optionally, enter a Custom first payment. A custom first payment must occur BEFORE the first payment in
the schedule and at least one day in the future. (Thus the 1st payment date must be BEFORE the schedule
Start date.)    
In payment plans, custom first payments are down‐payments on the Total due. Thus, when you enter a
custom 1st Payment amount, the system adjusts the Payment amount for the schedule.
In the example schedule:   
• Total Due = $200 and Number of payments = 4
• When custom 1st payment = 0, Payment amount = $50.00
• When custom 1st payment = $100.00, Payment amount = $25.00

To enter a custom first payment for the schedule:
  a. Select the Custom first payment checkbox.
  b. Enter the 1st payment amount.
  c. Place your cursor in the Payment date field and select the date from the pop‐up calendar on which you
want the custom first payment to be processed.  
NOTE: If you select the current day, the custom first payment will be processed when the schedule is
saved.
12. Select Credit card or echeck (ACH) in the Choose a Payment Method section.
NOTE: You will only see one option here if your account is configured for only Credit Card or only echeck
(ACH) processing, in which case you will not need to make a selection.
13. Select the credit card or bank account you want to use, or enter a new one.
  a. Credit Card: (See Using Credit Cards for New Payments and Schedules below for detailed instructions.)
  i. If using an existing card, select its radio button in the Use column, ask your customer for the card’s

in the fields located under the saved cards table.
NOTE: Entering the CVV2 code is optional. CVV2 validation is used as a security measure to verify
that the customer has the card in hand when authorizing the schedule. It will only be validated if
the custom first payment, or the first payment on the schedule, will take place on the current day.
The system will NEVER store the CVV2 code, so it cannot be validated on future transactions.
NOTE: If you want the new card to be the default account, check the Set as default account box.

entering a CCD transaction, make certain that your customer confirms that the account is
enabled for ACH. If it is not, you may be assessed Return fees and/or Chargeback fees.
  ii. Select a saved bank account to use, or enter a new one.
   1• For a saved account, select the radio button in the Use column for the account you want to charge.
NOTE: The default bank account will be automatically selected. (See About Default Payment
Accounts in Chapter 6 for details on setting and changing the default bank account.)
   2• For a new account, enter the Bank name, Bank routing number, Bank account number, and Account
type in the fields located under the saved accounts table.
NOTE: If you want the new account to be the default bank account, check the Set as default account
box.
14. Review the Email Receipt settings for the schedule and make any required changes. The settings in this
section are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to
configure receipt settings.)
   
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 86
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box.
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the receipt to that email
address.
• Enter a different email address in the Send to other field, or add an additional address to the field. You
can enter multiple addresses separated by commas. (Maximum 200 characters)
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a receipt to the customer, the email address(es) entered in the
Send to other field will be the email CC addresses. If send to customer box is not checked, then email
addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
15. Review the failed payment notification settings, and make any required changes. The settings in this section
are based on the Receipt and Notification settings you set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to
configure receipt settings.)   
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box.
• Check or un‐check the first and/or second box if you don’t want to send the failure notification to that
email address.
• Enter a different email address in the Send to other field, or add an additional address to the field. You
can enter multiple addresses separated by commas. (Maximum 200 characters)
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a failure notification to the customer, the email address(es)
entered in the Send to other field will be the email CC addresses. If send to customer box is not
checked, then email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
16. Review the Pre‐Notification Email settings. The settings in this section are based on the Receipt and
Notification settings set in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen. (See
Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for details on how to configure pre‐notification settings.)
Depending on your default settings, you can:
• Un‐check the Send schedule notification box if you don’t want to send the pre‐notification email.
NOTE: The pre‐notification email is always sent to the customer’s primary email address.
• Select a different email template from the drop‐down box.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 87
• Select a different number of Days Prior to the pre‐notification email. You can select any number of
days from 1 through 10.
17. Click the “create payment plan” button at the bottom right of the screen to save and activate the schedule.
Or click the “cancel” button to discard it. (See System Actions Upon Activating a Recurring Payment
Schedule below for exactly what happens when a schedule is saved.)
18. If there are any errors with the schedule, you will see an error message displayed at the top of the screen,
as shown below. You can then make corrections and re‐submit the schedule, or discard it.
19. When the schedule issuccessfully saved, you will see the table in the manage recurring paymentstab, with
a success message for the schedule, and the schedule you just processed at the top of the list, as shown.
• The first column will display the transaction Status as “Active.”
• The second column will display the Schedule Id for the schedule.
At this point, you can view schedule details by clicking the linked Schedule Id. (This view also contains a list of all
transactions generated by the schedule.)
CALCULATING PRE‐NOTIFICATION EMAIL DATE
The pre‐notification email is sent based on the Days Prior setting you select and the
scheduled payment date. For example, for a payment scheduled for January 8, pre‐
notification emails would be sent as follows:
• 1 Day Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 7
• 3 Days Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 5
• 5 Days Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 3
• 7 Days Prior: Pre‐notification email sent on January 1
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 88
You can also delete any payment plan schedule that has not yet started. You can also edit payment plan schedules
that have not yet started by selecting the “Edit” link from the Action menu.
For payment plans that have started you can only change the schedule payment account. This is done from the
Customers center, where you can delete the original payment account and replace it with a new one. (See
Managing Customer Payment Accounts in Chapter 6 for instructions.) These are the only changes allowed for active
payment schedules. If you need to change anything else on a payment plan, you will need to suspend the original
schedule and enter a new one.
See the following sections for detailed instructions on performing these tasks:
• Viewing Recurring Payment Schedules
• Editing Recurring Payment Schedules
• Deleting Recurring Payment Schedules that Have Not Started
• Suspending/Resuming Recurring Payment Schedules
System Actions Upon Activating a Recurring Payment Schedule
The following things occur when you successfully activate a recurring payment schedule:
1. Your customer receives an email notifying them that a new schedule has been entered. See Email
Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for detailed information on viewing and editing email templates.
(See Appendix D: Email Templates for a full inventory of the email templates included in your system.)
• The email template for a Recurring Billing schedule is “New Recurring Payment Schedule.”
• The email template for a Payment Plan schedule is “New Recurring Schedule‐‐Payment Plan.”
2. If a scheduled transaction or custom first payment is programmed to execute on the current day, that
transaction is processed immediately. You will see the transaction recorded in the Payments table on the
manage payments screen.
  a. If you have programmed receipts for the schedule, your customer will receive an emailed receipt for
the payment.
START DATE vs. FIRST PAYMENT DATE
The schedule Start date is the day the schedule is “activated.” When a schedule is
activated the system begins to monitor its frequency settings so that payments will be
generated per your configuration settings.
The schedule Frequency dictates when payments are actually generated.
For example:
     Start date = February 1, 2010
     Frequency = 1st of Month
     First Payment Date = February 1, 2010
     Start date = April 1, 2010
     Frequency = Last of Month
     First Payment Date = April 30, 2010
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 89
USING CREDIT CARDS FOR NEW PAYMENTS AND SCHEDULES
When entering a new one‐time credit card payment, or new recurring credit card payment schedule, you will need
to select credit card that will be charged. ADP Payments securely stores credit card information with a Customer
Record so that it can be easily accessed for future payments.
In the Choose A Payment Method section you can select any saved account to use with any new transaction, and
you can also enter new credit cards right from the collect new payment screen.  To do this, follow the steps below:
1. If there is a card (or cards) saved with the Customer Record, the screen will appear as shown below:
  a. If there is only one credit card saved, it is designated as the “default” account, and its radio button will
be automatically selected in the Use column. If there is more than one saved credit card, the “default”
account’s radio button will be selected in the Use column. To use the selected credit card for the
transaction, ask your customer for the card CVV2 code and enter it in the CVV2 Code field. (See About
the CID Number below for more information.)
  b. To use a different existing card, select its radio button in the Use column, ask your customer for the
card CVV2 code and enter it in the CVV2 Code field.
You cannot edit or delete credit cards from this screen, nor can you set or change the
default credit card. If you need to delete a credit card, edit a credit card expiration date,
or change the default credit card, you can do it from the Customer Record.   You cannot
edit credit card numbers in ADP Payments once they are saved. If you need to change a
credit card number, delete the original card and save a new credit card using the new
number.
See Managing Customer Payment Accounts in Chapter 6 for more information.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 90
2. If there is not a saved credit card, the screen will display new‐card entry fields, as shown below:
  a. Select the type of card (American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover) from the Card type drop‐down
box.
NOTE: Your account may not be configured to accept all 4 card types.
  b. Enter the credit card number (without any spaces or dashes) in the Card number field.
  c. Ask your customer for the card CVV2 Code, and enter it in the field. (Optional) See About the CID
Number below.
  d. In the Expiration date fields, select the expiration month in the first drop‐down box and the expiration
year in the second drop‐down box.
  e. Check the Set as default account box to set the account as the default.
NOTE: As this is the first saved credit card it will automatically be set as the default whether or not you
check the box.
About the CVV2 Code
The CVV2 Code is the three digit code located on the back of Visa, MasterCard, and
Discover cards, or the 4 digit code located on the front of American Express cards (as
shown below).
The CVV2 code is NEVER stored by the system, and for security reasons you should ask
your customer to provide this number each time a transaction is processed.
While not a requirement, performing a CVV2 validation is a good way to make certain
that the person authorizing a card‐not‐present transaction is not only authorized to use
the credit card, but also has it in his/her possession at the time the charge is being
authorized.  A successful CVV2 validation will help you defend a chargeback should
your customer claim a charge was not authorized.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 91
USING BANK ACCOUNTS FOR NEW PAYMENTS AND SCHEDULES
When entering a new one‐time echeck (ACH) payment, or new recurring echeck (ACH) payment schedule, you will
need to select the bank account that will be charged. ADP Payments securely stores bank account information with
a Customer Record so that it can be easily accessed for future payments without requiring unnecessary data entry.
In the Choose A Payment Method section you can select any stored account to use with any new transaction, and
you can also enter new bank accounts right from the collect new payment screen. To do this, follow these steps:
1. If there is a bank account or accounts saved with the Customer Record, the screen will appear as shown:
  a. If there is only one bank account saved, it is designated as the “default” account, and its radio button
will be automatically selected in the Use column. If there is more than one saved bank account, the
“default” account’s radio button will be selected in the Use column. Leave this as is to use the default
bank account for the transaction.
  b. To use a different existing bank account, select its radio button in the Use column.
You cannot edit or delete bank accountsfrom thisscreen, nor can you set or change the
default bank account. If you need to delete a bank account, edit a bank name or routing
number, or change the default account, you can do it from the Customer Record.   You
cannot edit bank account numbers in ADP Payments once they are saved. If you need
to change a bank account number, delete the original account and save a new bank
account using the new number.
See Managing Customer Payment Accounts in Chapter 6 for more information.
Chapter 4: Payments : New Payments and Schedules 92
2. If there are not any saved bank accounts, the screen will display new account entry fields, as shown below.
The new account you enter will be used for the payment.
  a. Enter the name of the bank in the Bank name field.
  b. Enter the 9‐digit bank routing number in the Bank routing number field.
  c. Enter the bank account number in the Bank account number field.
  d. Select “Checking” or “Savings” as appropriate, from the Account type drop‐down box.
  e. If you want to set the new account as the default bank account, check the Set as default box.
NOTE: As this is the first saved credit card it will automatically be set as the default whether or not you
check the box.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 93
 Managing Payments
The manage payments tab, in the Payments center, shown below, provides access to all transactions processed in
your ADP Payments system‐‐ Whether one‐time payments entered by you and your staff, online payments initiated
by your customers, or automated payments generated by recurring payment schedules.
From the manage payments screen you can void and refund transactions, view and print transaction details, view
complete transaction history, and filter payments history views by customer, date and transaction status.
The following sections provide detailed instructions for performing these functions.
THE PAYMENTS TABLE
When you click on the manage paymentstab, the default screen view displays the Payments table, which is a report
of all payments processed in your ADP Payments system over the past 30 days, with the most recent transaction
listed first.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 94
The snapshots at the top right of the screen displays the total dollar value of payments that have settled in the
current month (Status = Settled), and payments that failed in the current month (Status = Failed). Click the linked
dollar value to display the payments included in that total in the table below.
NOTE: Only transactions that fail outright are included in this total. ACH Returns, and all Chargebacks are not
included.
The graphs provides a trend line for settled and failed payments over the last six months. Click on a mini‐graph to
open a larger version. Click the “close” button on the large graph to close it.
The transaction table displays 10 rows at a time, and lists the newest transactions within the date range first. Click
the linked page numbers at the bottom of the table to navigate through the table results.    
You can access view, print, void, and refund functions from the Action menu for each transaction. To do this, click
the Action button, then click on the function you want to perform from the menu.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 95
You can click any of the column headers to sort the table results based on that column, as follows:   
• Status‐‐ Sorts the transactions alphabetically by Status.  Click once to sort from Z‐to‐A, click again to
sort from A‐to‐Z.
• Confirm. #‐‐ Sorts the transactions alphanumerically by confirmation number. If the Confirm. # begins
with “R” the transaction was generated by a recurring schedule. The “R” is ignored when sorting. Thus
Confirm. # “123” is followed by Confirm. # “R124.” Click once to sort high‐to‐low (which is the same as
newest‐ to‐oldest), click again to sort low‐to‐high (the same as oldest‐to‐newest)
NOTE: The Confirm. # is referenced as the Transaction ID in reports and in the Transaction Details
screen.
• Customer‐‐ Sorts the transactions alphabetically by Company Name. Customers without a company
name will have their full name displayed in this field. Click once to sort from Blank‐to‐Z, click again to
sort from Z‐to‐Blank. (For customers without a company, this effectively sorts by first name).
NOTE: If the full name is not displayed, roll your mouse over the “...” to see it.
• Customer last name‐‐ Sorts the transactions alphabetically by Last Name.  Click once to sort from A‐to‐
Z, click again to sort from Z‐to‐A.
• Amount paid‐‐ Sorts the transactions numerically by dollar amount.  Click once to sort low‐to‐high,
click again to sort high‐to‐low.
• Date paid‐‐ Sorts the transactions by enter date.  Click once to sort oldest‐to‐newest, click again to sort
newest‐to‐oldest. (The default table view is sorted newest‐to‐oldest.)
• Invoice #‐‐ Sorts the transactions by alphanumeric invoice number. If you did not provide an invoice
number for a particular payment, this field will be blank. Blanks appear at the low end of the sort. Click
once to sort from Z‐to‐Blank. Click again to sort from Blank‐to‐Z.
NOTE: You will always know which column is being used to sort the table, and whether the sort is high‐
to‐low or low‐to‐high, by looking for the arrow indicators next to the column headers, as shown below:
You can also filter the one‐time transactions table by transaction status, enter date, and customer, as described in
the following sections. You can use any combination of filters to refine your list.   For example, shown below, this is
how you would find all payments for Sam Pell entered between August 1, 2011 and August 15, 2011 with a Status of
“Settled:”
• Set transaction Status Display filter to “Settled.”
• Set Date range filter to August 1 ‐ August 15, 2011.
• Use the Search field to select “Sam Pell” as the active customer.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 96
   
To clear filters and return to the full transaction list, click the “Clear Search” link.
Filter by Transaction Status
The transaction status filter instructs the report to return only those transactions that match the selected settings.  
The following transaction status filters are available:
• All Payments‐‐ The default view when you open the manage payments screen. Click the “clear search”
link to return to this view. Or, select “All” in the filters list.
• Authorized Payments‐‐ Credit card payments that have been authorized, but not yet submitted for
processing.
• Pending Payments‐‐The initial stage for every transaction sent for authorization. The system assigns
this status while waiting for an authorization response. In some rare cases, if communication is
disrupted before the system gets a response, the transaction will remain in the “Pending” status.
NOTE: If you see a credit card transaction with a status of “Pending” you can be assured that it failed
and was not submitted for processing. For ACH transactions, wait until the Expected Settle Date to see
if the transaction has settled or returned. If not, contact ADP Payments Customer Care so that we can
determine the actual status for the transaction.
• Posted Payments‐‐ Credit Card and ACH payments that have been entered in the system, but not yet
settled.
• Settled Payments‐‐ Successful payments for which you have received funds and successful credits
when the funds have been debited from your account. For settled payments, the Amount paid will be
green in the table. (Settled credits will continue to show the Amount in (red).)
• Failed Payments‐‐ Attempted payments that were never authorized.
• Voided Payments‐‐ Any payment that was voided prior to it being submitted for processing.
• Refunded Payments‐‐A transaction that has been reversed (refunded). When you issue a refund for a
settled transaction, the status of that transaction changes to “Refunded.”
• Refund (Posted) Payments‐‐ The credit transaction generated when a settled transaction is refunded
or when you process a standalone refund. The dollar value of this transaction will appear as negative
and in red. i.e. ($5.00).
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 97
• Refund (Settled) Payments‐‐A settled refund transaction. When funds have been deducted from your
account for a “Refund (Posted)” payment, the status changes to “Refund (Settled).” The dollar value of
this transaction will appear as negative and in red. i.e. ($5.00).
• Returned Payments‐‐ ACH payments that were unsuccessful for any reason other than non‐sufficient
funds or chargeback. The Reason Description field on the Transaction Details screen will display a
return code for this payment, and there will be an entry in the Return Date field for the date the return
was recorded.(See Appendix B: ACH Return Codes for more information on ACH Returns.)
• Returned NSF Payments‐‐ An ACH transaction that failed because your customer had insufficient funds
in the account to cover the payment. The Reason Description field on the Transaction Details screen
will display an R01 return code for this payment, and there will be an entry in the Return Date field for
the date the return was recorded.
NOTE: You can manually re‐process this payment again to attempt to collect.
• Chargeback Payments‐‐ A payment being disputed by your customer.
NOTE: Only ACH Chargebacks are currently recorded in ADP Payments. Credit Card Chargebacks are
reported to you by your merchant processing company directly, and are handled completely outside
the system, thus their status is not updated to “Chargeback” in ADP Payments.
To create a transaction status filter, follow the steps below:
1. Click the down arrow for the Display drop‐down box, as shown below:
2. Check the boxes for the statuses you want to include in the table.
3. Click the “view selected payments” button.
4. The drop‐down box will close, and the table will be filtered based on the statuses you selected.
To clear all filters, including the Status filter, click the “Clear Search” link.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 98
Filter by Enter Date
The Date range filter instructs the report to return only those transactions that were entered into ADP Payments
during the selected date range. You can select one of the pre‐configured filters listed below, or enter your own
custom date range for the filter.
• 12 months‐‐ Transactions entered over the past 360 days.
• Last 6 months‐‐ Transactions entered over the past 180 days.
• Last 90 days‐‐ Transactions  entered over the past 90 days.
• Last 30 days‐‐ Transactions entered over the past 30 days. The default view when you open the
manage payments screen.
• Last 15 days‐‐ Transactions entered over the past 15 days.
• Today‐‐ Transactions entered on the current calendar day.
• Yesterday‐‐ Transactions entered on the previous calendar day.
• All‐‐ All transactions processed in your system.
To create an entry date filter, follow the steps below:
1. Click the down‐arrow for the Dated within field.
2. The date filter will appear as shown below:
3. Select the date range to filter.
  a. To use a pre‐programmed range, click the linked date rage.  For example, to view payments entered
within the last 15 days, click the “15 days” link.
  b. To enter a Custom Date Range:
  i. Place your cursor in the From field to open the calendar.
  ii. Click the day on which you want to start the filter, or type a date in the field.
  iii. Place your cursor in the To field to open the calendar.
  iv. Click the day on which you want to end the filter, or type a date in the field.
  v. Click the “GO” button.
NOTE: If you want to see one whole day of transactions, enter the same date in the From and To
fields.
4. The drop‐down box will close, and the table will be filtered based on the date range you selected.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 99
Filter by Customer Name
The customer filter instructs the report to return transactions that were entered into ADP Payments for a specific
customer. The filter will not permit you to display transactions from multiple customers. For example, by typing
“Smith” into the box, you cannot return transactions for all customers with a last name of “Smith.”
The customer filter is a context‐sensitive search. This means that you can enter any three character part of a
customer’s first name, last name, or company name in the Search field, and the search will return all matches for
that string.   In the example shown below, the search string “pell” returned matches for a customers with a last name
of “Pell” as well as companies that have names containing “pell.”
NOTE: You can also enter the customer’s complete Customer ID in the Search field to locate the Customer Record.
Adaptive search does not work with Customer ID.   
Follow the steps below to create a customer filter:
1. Enter any 3 character part of a customer’s first name, last name, company name in the Search field, or
enter a complete Customer ID.
2. Click on the customer you want to use as a filter from the list of matches.
3. The drop‐down box will close, and the table will be filtered based on the customer you selected.
To remove the customer filter you must clear all filters by clicking the “Clear Search” link.
When selecting the From and To dates, you can navigate months using the forward and
back arrows in the calendar.  Or, click the month, year heading at the top of the
calendar, to change to a full year view.  
Advance years by using the left and right arrows, then click on the month to open the
calendar page and select a specific day.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 100
VIEWING TRANSACTION DETAILS
Payment details for any given transaction can be accessed in two ways:
• Click a linked Confirm. # in the Payments table, or in any other table or report where it is linked.
• Select the “View transaction details” link from the Action menu in the Payments table.
A sample of the Transaction Details screen is shown below. Key components include:
1. Transaction ID‐‐ This is the unique identifier ADP Payments attaches to the payment. This number is the
same as the Confirm. # in the View one‐time payment history table.
NOTE: Payments generated by schedules will always have a Transaction ID that begins with an “R.”
2. Authorization Code‐‐ The authorization number provided by the Credit Card or ACH processor when the
payment is approved for processing. This is the unique identifier the Processor attaches to the payment.
3. Amount ‐‐ The amount of the transaction. Payments will appear positive, and credits or reversals will
appear negative.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 101
4. Status‐‐The status of the payment. (See Filter by Transaction Status above for Status definitions.)
5. Reason Description‐‐ This field provides an explanation for a transaction Status.  
• If Status = “Settled” or “Authorized” or “Posted” Reason Description = “Approved.”
• If Status = “Returned” or “Returned NSF” Reason Description = the ACH Return Code which indicates
why the transaction failed. (See Appendix B: ACH Return Codes.)
• If Status = “Failed” Reason Description= a brief reason why.
• If Status = “Chargeback” Reason Description = ACH Return Code.
6. Can Void Until‐‐ This date indicates when the transaction will be submitted for processing. You will be able
to void it at any point PRIOR to the listed date. You will know if a transaction can be voided if you see the
“void” button on the transaction details page (see #12 below).
7. Transaction Type‐‐ For credit card transactions this field indicates that the transaction is MOTO (Mail
order/telephone order). For ACH transactions, it indicates the ACH Type used (TEL, PPD, CCD, WEB).
8. Invoice #‐‐ The invoice number attached to the payment.   If the invoice number is for an invoice sent from
ADP Payments it will be linked (as in the example above) and you can click it to view the invoice.
9. Customer ID‐‐ The linked ID for the customer who made the payment. You can click this link to view the
complete Customer Record.
10. Custom Fields‐‐ Any custom fields attached to the Payment module or the Customer module will appear in
this section. (See Custom Fields in Chapter 8 for more information on creating custom fields.)
11. “email transaction” button‐‐ Click this button to open a pop‐up window so you can enter any email
address to which you want to send the transaction details. This is very useful if a customer asks you to send
a copy of a payment receipt.
If an Echeck (ACH) transaction has a status of “Returned” or “Returned NSF” there will
be an additional line on the Transaction Details screen called “Return Date” for the
date the transaction was returned, as shown below.
For example, in the above screen capture the transaction was originally settled on May
18, 2011, but was returned for insufficient funds on May 21, 2011.
For reconciliation purposes, you would note a deposit for the transaction on the 18th,
and a debit for that same amount on the 21st.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 102
12. “void” button‐‐ This button will only be visible if the transaction status is “authorized” for credit card
transactions or “posted” for ACH transactions, and if the “Void until” date has not yet passed. Click it to
void the transaction.
NOTE: For “settled” transactions a “refund” button will replace the “void” button.
13. “return to transaction list” link‐‐ Click this link to return to the transaction table you were viewing prior to
opening the transaction details page.
14. Email History‐‐ This table displays all emails sent in relation to the transaction. You are shown the date the
email was sent, the email address to which it was sent, and the linked subject line of the email. Clicking the
linked email subject line opens a pop‐up window containing the full text of the email sent. (Click the OK
button to close the pop‐up.)
15. Action links
  a. “create similar transaction” Click this link to open a collect new payment screen with the details of the
current transaction pre‐loaded. Use the copy to create a new payment for the same customer or a
different customer. (See Creating Similar Transactions below.)
  b. “print”   Click this link to print a copy of the transactions details. (See Printing Payment Details below.)
EXPORTING PAYMENT HISTORY
You can export your payment history as a .csv (comma delimited text) file that can be opened in Excel for advanced
reporting and charting, or can be imported into any other software system that accepts .csv imports.
The export file will contain all of the records included in the Payments table. Thus, to export a subset of your
transactions, first filter the table. For example:
• To export all of your transactions select “All” as the date filter.
• To export all transactions for a single customer, use the Customer filter. (See Filter by Customer Name
above.)
• To export all “Settled” transactions, use the Status filter. (See Filter by Transaction Status above.)
• To export all transactions for the current day, use the Date filter. (See Filter by Enter Date above.)
• To export all “Failed” transactions for the current day, use both the Status filter and the Date filter.
The following sections describe how to export the file and define each column in the export.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 103
How to Export Payment History
Follow the steps below to export your filtered payment history to a .csv file.
1. Go to the manage payments screen.
2. Filter the table to define the data set for the export, or leave the default selection of all transactions.
3. Click the “export” link at the very top of the table, as shown:
4. Depending on your browser, you will have the option to open and/or save the file.
  a. To open the file, click the “Open” button in the dialog box. In most cases (unless you have your system
default .csv files to a different program), the file will open in Excel, but will not be saved. You will need
to save the file if you want to store it on your computer.
When you export the payment history file you will have a choice to open it or to save it.
If you select “open” the file will typically open in Excel. However, because this is a .csv
file Excel will often corrupt the data‐‐ for example by removing leading zeros on routing
numbers and zip codes.
If you want to use your export in Excel, the best practice is to save the .csv file to your
hard drive. Then open a new workbook in Excel and import the .csv file. During the
import process you can designate fieldssuch asrouting numbers, account numbers and
zip codes as “text” fields instead of number fields so that your data is not corrupted.
For detailed instructions on how to import .csv files into Excel, consult the Excel Help
files.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 104
  b. To save the file to your computer:

Field Definitions for the Payment History Export File
The payment history export file is not customizable. All exports contain the same set of fields, with the same field
names in the same order. These fields are defined in the table below.
NOTE: Custom Fields are not included in payment history exports.
Export Field Name
Transaction

Field Name
Description
Id Transaction ID The unique transaction identifier assigned by the sys‐
tem. When viewing transactions in the ADP Payments
application, payments generated by schedules preface
this ID with an “R.” The “R” is not included in the
export.
CustomerId Customer ID The unique identifier assigned to the customer
charged.
You can use the Customer ID as the database “key”
when integrating ADP Payments data with external sys‐
tems.
Customer_Contact_FirstName Name The First Name for your customer’s Primary Contact.
Customer_Contact_LastName Name The Last Name for your customer’s Primary Contact.
Customer_Contact_CompanyName Company The Company for the customer.
ProviderAuthCode Reason Descrip‐
tion
The response to a transaction authorization request. If
the transaction is authorized this field will be blank or
“Approved.” If the transaction fails, this field will pro‐
vide a brief description of why.
TraceNumber Authorization
Code
The authorization code sent by the processor when a
transaction is approved.
EstimatedSettledDate Estimated Settle‐
ment Date
The date the system estimates a transaction will settle.
NOTE: You can ignore the time‐stamp in this field, it is
not accurate.
IsDebit N/A This field = “False” for payments and “True” for credits
and refunds. It is used to determine whether the
“Amount” field is a positive or negative number.
Amount Amount The absolute value of a transaction amount. This field
will always be positive. Refer to the “IsDebit” field t
determine whether the actual transaction is for a posi‐
tive or negative amount.
NOTE: Because the Amount field is always positive, you
cannot use an payment history export to sum the total
value of exported transactions. To get an accurate sum,
you will need to change the Amount field to a negative
number for each transaction where the “IsDebit” field
= “True.”

PRINTING PAYMENT DETAILS
You can print transaction details by clicking the “print” link on any transaction details page. (See Viewing
Transaction Details above for how to open a transaction details page.)
You can also print any settled transaction by clicking the “Print payment confirmation” link in the Action menu in the
manage payments screen.
Once you have clicked a “print” link:
1. A new window opens with a preview of the transaction details in print format.
2. A dialog box opens for your computer’s default printer.
3. Select a different printer if you like, then click “Print” to print the page, or “Cancel” if you don’t want to
print.
4. Close the Print Preview window when you are done.
CREATING SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS
To help make payment processing easier, ADP Payments provides the ability to exactly copy all components of an
existing payment into a new collect new payment screen.   All fields are copied exactly except for the Payment date,
which defaults to the current date. This should help you eliminate duplicate data entry if you often process the same
or similar payments, either for the same customer or for different customers.
You can copy a transaction by clicking the “create similar transaction” link on any transaction details page. (See
Viewing Transaction Details above for how to open a transaction details page.)
You can also copy the transaction by clicking the “Create similar transaction” link in the Action menu in the manage
payments screen.
Once you have clicked a “Create similar transaction” link:
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 108
1. The collect new payment screen opens with all fields (except Payment date, which defaults to the current
date) filled based on the values from the original transaction.
2. The Customer from the original transaction is active in the form. You can leave this as is to charge the same
customer, or you can search for and load a different customer into the form.
NOTE: If you select a different customer, the Payment method will remain the same and the default
account for that method will be automatically selected.
3. You can make changes to any of the fields, payment accounts, and email notifications as required.
4. Click the “collect payment” button to process the new payment.
5. You are returned to the manage payments screen. The new transaction is at the top of the table, and a
success message for the transaction is displayed above the table.
You cannot add a new customer to a copied transaction.
If you click the “add new customer” link from a copied transaction screen you will be
able to add the new customer, but when you are returned to the collect new payment
screen the new customer will be active but all copied field values will be lost.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 109
VOIDING TRANSACTIONS
Any transaction that has not yet been submitted for processing can be voided. To prevent errors, ADP Payments will
only provide access to the Void function prior to submission.
The Transaction Details page contains a “Can Void Until” field which will tell you when void functionality will be
terminated for a particular transaction. (See Viewing Transaction Details above.) The date in this field is the last date
upon which the Void function will be available‐‐ This is usually the same day that you entered the payment or credit.
But in some cases such as weekends or holidays, it may be several days in the future.
The Void function can be accessed in the following ways:
• By clicking the “void” button at the bottom of any Transaction Details page, as shown below:
• By clicking the Action button for the transaction you want to void, and then clicking the “Void” link, as
shown below:
   
After you click the “Void” link or button:
1. A pop‐up window will appear asking you to confirm the void.
2. Click “Yes” to proceed or “No” to leave the payment as is.
3. If you click “Yes” you will see a confirmation pop‐up window. Click “OK” to close it and return to the
manage payments screen.
4. The status of the payment will change from “Authorized” (CC) or “Posted” (ACH) or “Refund (Posted)” to
“Voided.”
NOTE: For voided refunds, when the transaction changesfrom “Refund (Posted)” to “Voided” on the refund
transaction, the status of the original transaction changes from “Refunded” to “Settled.”
5. Your customer will receive an email confirming the void.
NOTE: The email will always be sent to the Email address defined in the customer record, regardless of any
special email settings attached to the payment.
Once a transaction is voided you cannot cancel the void. If you decide that you really do want to process the
transaction, you’ll need to enter it again as a new payment or credit.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 110
REFUNDING PAYMENTS
Any payment that has a status of “Settled” can be refunded. To prevent you from entering a refund prior to actually
receiving funds for a payment, ADP Payments will only provide access to the Refund function after the transaction is
settled and you have been paid.
NOTE: If you want to enter a standalone credit to a credit card instead of refunding a specific transaction you can do
that from the collect new payment screen. (See Entering One‐time Standalone Credits above for instructions.)
The Refund function can be accessed in the following ways:
By clicking the “refund” button at the bottom of any transaction details page, as shown below:
By clicking the Action button for the settled transaction you want to refund, and clicking the “Refund” link as shown
below:
After you click the “Refund” link or button:
1. A pop‐up window will appear asking you to confirm the refund.
2. Click “Yes” to proceed or “No” to leave the payment as is.
3. If you click “Yes” you will see a confirmation pop‐up window. Click “OK” to close it and return to the
manage payments screen.
4. The status of the original payment will change from “Settled” to “Refunded” and you will see a new
transaction for the refund with the status of “Refund (Posted).”   When the new refund transaction settles,
the status will update to “Refund (Settled).”
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Payments 111
NOTE: The Amount paid column will show the “Refund (Posted)” transaction with the dollar value as
negative and in red‐‐i.e. ($120.00).
NOTE: Your customer will receive an email confirming the refund. The email will always be sent to the Email
address defined in the customer record, regardless of any special email settings attached to the payment.
5. When you view the Transaction Details page for the original transaction, the Reversed by Transaction ID
field provides a link to the refund transaction.   
6. When you view the Transaction Details page for the refund transaction, the Reversal of Transaction ID
field provides a link to the original transaction.   
You can void any “Refund (Posted)” transaction if you want to cancel the refund.
When you void a “Refund (Posted)” transaction, the status of the refund transaction
changes to “Voided” and the status of the original transaction changes from
“Refunded” back to “Settled.”
See Voiding Transactions for instructions on how to void.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 112
Importing One-time Payments
There are two types of One‐time Payment Imports:
• Existing Customer (with Customer IDs).
For these import files, you provide the ADP Payments Customer ID, the amount and method of
payment, and the system processes the payment using the default account for the payment method
selected.
• New Customer (without Customer IDs).
For these import files, all required fields for a Customer and all required fields for a Payment must be
provided.
All import transactions are processed immediately and appear in the manage payments screen.
Detailed field requirements for one‐time payment imports, as well as all ADP Payments imports, can be found in
Appendix C: Import Requirements.
This section covers how to import one‐time payment batches. For more information on the ADP Payments Import
Center, and batch status and error reporting, see Import Center in Chapter 8.
The following sections provide instructions for importing transactions for new and existing customers.
IMPORTING PAYMENTS FOR NEW CUSTOMERS
When a Payment import file is processed by ADP Payments, the system creates a new Customer Record, assigns a
Customer ID for each customer in the file, and it processes a payment for the customer.
The system will email a receipt to each customer using the email address included in the import file.
NOTE: If you do not include an email address for a customer, the payment will still be processed but no receipt will
be sent.
After the initial import, you can process additional payments for the imported customers from the Payments center
or via another payment import using the assigned Customer ID.
The following are the basic steps to take when importing a new customer payment file into ADP Payments:
1. Create your Payment import file.
2. Upload the file into ADP Payments on the Settings‐‐> Import Center screen.
You can use a single Payment import file to upload payments for new and existing
customers. To do this, make certain that your file includes a column for each field
required to import both new and existing customer payments. Each row for a new
customer must contain data in all required fields(columns) for new customer entry and
for new payment entry. Each row for an existing customer must contain data in all of
the required fields (columns) for processing a payment for an existing customer.
Make sure you map all fields when importing your file. The system will simply ignore
fields that are not relevant on a row‐by‐row basis.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 113
3. Map fields from your file to ADP Payments system fields.
4. Review your field mapping.
5. Submit the Payment import file for processing.
6. View the results of the import.
The following sections walk you through all of these steps.
Creating a Payment Import File for New Customers
ADP Payments import files must be in .csv (comma delimited text) format or pipe delimited text format. All fields,
including date fields, must be formatted as text fields. All credit card account numbers must also be entered without
any dashes or spaces.
You can use column headers in your file if you like. (You can also upload files without headers.) You do not need to
use the ADP Payments field names in your header row. Use field names you will easily recognize since you will be
mapping these fields to ADP Payments system fields during the import process.
For more information on proper formatting of ADP Payments import files, see Appendix C: Import Requirements.
(For details specific to Payment imports, see One Time Payment Import Requirements for Existing Customers)
When creating new customers and payments via an import file you can include any fields available in the Customer
Record, as well as all fields required to process a payment for a new customer. For a complete list and description of
all fields available in a new customer Payment Import see One Time Payment Import Requirements for New
Customers.
The following fields are required for all Payment import files containing new customers.
• First Name
• Last Name
• Billing Address 1   
• City
• State/Province
• Zip/Postal Code
NOTE: Country is not a required field. But, if you do not map the Country field, or if the row does not
contain a value for it, the field will default to “USA.”
• Payment Amount
• Payment Type (Enter “ACH” or “CC”)
Do not use commas in any of the fields when creating a .csv import file.  Doing so will
corrupt your data and cause values to be mapped to the wrong fields.  For example,
you should never enter a company name as “ABC Company, Inc.”  Instead, enter “ABC
Company Inc.”
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 114
• If Payment Type = “ACH” then ACH Type is also a required field. Enter “PPD” “CCD” “WEB” or “TEL”
(See Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions for more information on ACH Types.)
NOTE: If you enter “CCD” asthe ACH Type, you must also enter a Company Name for the customer,
or the payment will fail.
• Payment account information fields as follows:
• Credit Card Accounts
• Credit Card Number (no dashes or spaces)
• Card Type: Enter "AMEX" or “Visa" or "Master" or “Discover"
• Expiration Date (MM/YY)
• Bank Accounts
• Account Type: Enter “Checking” or “Savings”
• Bank Name
• Bank Account Number
• Routing Number
A sample new customer Payment import file created in Excel is shown below:
The easiest way to create and save your Payment import file is to create it in Excel then export it as a .csv file.  To do
this, use the “save as” function in Excel, and select “comma delimited csv” as the file type.
Once you save an Excel file as a .csv file, it is very important that you do not open or
edit the .csv file in Excel prior to importing it into ADP Payments. Doing this will corrupt
the file and cause import errors.
If you need to make a change to the data in your Payment import file, open the Excel
file, edit the file, then use the “save as” function again to save the edited file in .csv
format.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 115
Uploading a Payment Import File for New Customers
Once you have created your Payment import file, follow these steps to import it into ADP Payments.
1. Go to the ADP Payments Import Center. Do one of the following:
  a. Click the “Import” link at the top of the Payments table, as shown:
  b. Click the “Settings” link in top navigation, then click on the “Import Center” tab.
2. The Import Center dashboard screen opens, as shown below. (For more information on the Import Center
dashboard see Import Center Dashboard in Chapter 8.)

4. Enter a short descriptive name for your import in the Import name field. This name will be used when
referencing this particular import batch in tables on the Import Center dashboard.
5. Enter a short description of the upload in the Import description field. (Optional)
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 116
6. In the File type drop‐down box select the type of file you will be importing.  You can use a .csv file
(recommended) or a pipe‐delimited text file.
7. If the file you are importing contains a header row, check the First row is header checkbox. (Using a header
row is very helpful for the field mapping that you will perform in Step 11.)   If there is no header row, leave
this box unchecked.
8. Click the “Choose File” button to locate the import batch file on your computer.
9. Click the “upload” button to begin the import process.
10. The system will perform a preliminary validation of your file. If it is corrupt or unusable, you will see an
error message. Otherwise, you will see the Map Field Titles screen, shown below:    
• The first column displays the values in the first row of each column in your file. These will either be the
values in your header row, or the first row of data (if your file does not contain a header row).
• The second column contains drop‐down boxes used to map fields in your file to ADP Payments system
fields.
• The Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box enables you to select a saved mapping schema. (See
About Saved Mapping Schemes in Chapter 8 for instructions on using saved mappings.)
• The “reset mapping” button will clear all values in the System Field Names drop‐down boxes so that
you can begin the mapping process again.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 117
• The help box, located under the “reset mapping” button provides definitions for all of the ADP
Payments system fields. Select a field name from the drop‐down, and its definition will appear under
the box.
• For each column you want to map from your file, select a corresponding ADP Payments field from the
associated drop‐down box, as shown below. If you do not want to map a field from your file, leave the
corresponding drop‐down box set to “‐Select Column‐.”
NOTE: Fields that you select will disappear from the list of available fields. This prevents you from
accidentally creating duplicate mappings.   
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 118
11. Once you have finished mapping fields it should look something like the sample below. Click the “continue”
button.
12. On the next screen (shown below), enter a name for the mapping you just created in the Mapping Name
field. You can select this mapping at a later date from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box to quickly
map a file using the same column structure.
NOTE: You are required to save your mapping. Even if you never expect to use it again, storing it will save
time if there is an error processing your import file and you need to upload your file again.
13. Enter a Description for the mapping if you like. (Optional)
14. Click the “save & continue” button.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 119
15. The Approve File Import For Processing screen appears, as shown below.    
• The top line (in white) contains the ADP Payments system field names, in alphabetical order.
• The second line (in purple) appears only if your file has a header row, and contains the field names in
that header row.
• The following 5 lines (in white) contain the first 5 data rows from your file. You can scroll through them
in the table.
NOTE: Credit card numbers are encrypted immediately upon being uploaded into ADP Payments, so
you will only see the last four digits of a credit card number in the table.
16. Double check that your mapping correctly matched fields in your file to ADP Payments system fields.
  a. If you see an error, click the “back to mapping” button to return to the mapping screen (Step •), correct
any errors, and proceed.
  b. When you’re satisfied with the mapping, click the “approve batch” button.
17. When the file is successfully uploaded and queued for processing, you’ll see an on‐screen success message
as shown below. (If there are errors you’ll see an on‐screen message indicating the corrections that need to
be made.)
18. Click the “Import Center” link to return to the Import Center dashboard and view the status of your file.
19. Continue with Viewing Results from a Payment Import.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 120
IMPORTING PAYMENTS FOR EXISTING CUSTOMERS
With ADP Payments you can import payments for existing customers without having to upload their bank account
and credit card information each time. This means that you can enter account information into ADP Payments once
and let the system securely store that information for future payments. You do not need to retain that information in
your own systems.
When ADP Payments processes an imported payment for an existing customer, the system uses the customer’s
default credit card for credit card transactions and the customer's default bank account for echeck (ACH)
transactions.
The default credit card account is indicated by a check in the Default column in the Credit Card accounts table in the
Customer Record. The default bank account is indicated by a check in the Default column in the echeck (ACH)
accounts table in the Customer Record. (See About Default Payment Accounts in Chapter 6.)
You can locate the Customer ID for any customer by editing or viewing a Customer Record. The Customer ID is
located at the very top of the Customer Details or Edit Customer screen, as shown below:
You can also export your entire customer list, including the Customer ID for each customer. (See Exporting the
Customer List in Chapter 6 for instructions.)
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 121
The basic steps for importing a payment file for existing customers into ADP Payments are:
1. Locate the Customer ID for each of the customers for which you want to process a payment.
2. Create your Payment import file.
3. Upload the file into ADP Payments on the Settings‐‐>import center screen.
4. Map fields from your file to ADP Payments system fields.
5. Review your file mapping.
6. Submit the Payment import file for processing.
7. View the results of the import.
The following sections walk you through these steps.
Creating a Payment Import File for Existing Customers
ADP Payments import files must be in .csv (comma delimited text) format or pipe delimited text format. All fields,
including date fields, must be formatted as text fields. All credit card account numbers must also be entered without
any dashes or spaces.
You can use column headers in your file if you like. (You can also upload files without headers.) You do not need to
use the ADP Payments field names in your header row. Use field names you will easily recognize, since you will be
mapping these fields to ADP Payments system fields during the import process.
For more information on proper formatting of ADP Payments import files, see Appendix C: Import Requirements.
(For details specific to Payment imports, see One‐time Payment Import Requirements in Appendix )
NOTE: You can include as many fields as you like in the import file, but the system will only import data for the fields
you map to ADP Payments system fields. This saves time when exporting data from another system, since you will
not need to filter the data before uploading the file into ADP Payments.
Only the following required and optional fields are available in Payment import files for existing customers: (See One
Time Payment Import Requirements for Existing Customers for details.)
• Required Fields
• Customer ID
• Payment Amount
• Payment Type (Enter “ACH” or “CC”)
When entering payments for existing customers you cannot edit existing values in a
Customer Record. Any changes you make to Customer Record fields will be ignored if
you provide and map a Customer ID in your import row.
For example, if for Customer ID 1234 the system shows a first name of “Bobby,” you
cannot change that to “Robert” by entering “Robert” in the “First Name” field of an
existing customer Payment import file.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing One‐time Payments 122
• If Payment Type = “ACH”, then ACH Type is also a required field. Enter “PPD” “CCD” “WEB” or “TEL”
(See Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions for more information on ACH Types.)
NOTE: If you enter “CCD” as the ACH Type, there must be a Company Name included in the
Customer Record, or the payment will fail.
• Optional Fields
• Invoice number   
• P.O. Number
• Description
• Payment Custom Fields
A sample new customer Payment import file created in Excel is shown below:   
NOTE: The First Name and Last Name columns are for reference purposes. They will not be mapped as part of the
import into ADP Payments.
The easiest way to set‐up and save your Payment import file is to create it in Excel then export it as a .csv file.  To do
this, use the “save as” function in Excel, and select “comma delimited .csv” as the file type.
Uploading a Payment Import File for Existing Customers
Once you have created your Payment import file, follow these steps to import it into ADP Payments:
1. Go to the ADP Payments Import Center. Do one of the following:
  a. Click the “Import” link at the top of the Payments table, as shown:
Once you save an Excel file as a .csv file, it is very important that you do not open or

VIEWING RESULTS FROM A PAYMENT IMPORT
After you successfully import your file, you will see your file in one of the Import Center tables. (See Import Center
Dashboard in Chapter 8 for details on this screen.)
• Imports Queued for Processing: If your file is in this table, it is waiting to be processed. Check back
later for a final status.
• Imports Needing Attention: All or part of the file has not been processed. Click the “View Errors” link
to view problems. (See Troubleshooting Import Batch Errors in Chapter 8 for how to troubleshoot
“Needs Attention” batches.)
• Processing Imports: Your file is currently being processed by the system.
Completed Imports: (shown below): Your file has been processed by the system, all rows were successfully
imported, all customers were added, and all payments were successfully processed.   
If your import was successful, you should see payments recorded for all rows in the file in the manage payments
screen. (See The Payments Table above.)
For new customer Payment import files, you should also see new Customer Records created for each customer in
your file. You can now process additional payments for these customers in addition to entering payment schedules,
invoices, and invoice schedules for them‐‐ exactly as you would with customers manually entered into ADP
Payments.
If there were errors in a new customer Payment import file related to processing the
payment, the file will be listed in the Imports Needing Attention section of the Import
Center dashboard, and it will appear that the entire row did not get processed.
However, in some cases ADP Payments will have created a new Customer Record for
that row in the file even though the system did not process the payment.
Before re‐importing the row, be sure to check the Customers center to see if a Customer
Record was created.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 128
 Managing Recurring Payments
The manage recurring payments tab in the Payments center, shown below, provides access to all schedules entered
in your ADP Payments system‐‐ Whether entered by you and your staff, or entered by your customers via an online
payment form.   
From the manage recurring payments screen, you can suspend and re‐activate schedules, edit schedules that have
not yet started, view and print schedule details as well as a list of transactions generated by each schedule, and filter
schedule table views by customer, date and schedule status.
The following sections provide detailed instructions for performing these functions.
THE RECURRING PAYMENTS TABLE
When you click on the manage recurring payments tab, the default screen view displays a table report of all active
payment schedules in your ADP Payments system with the most recent schedule listed first, as shown below:
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 129
The snapshot at the top right of the screen displays the total dollar value of payments that will be generated by
schedules in the current month (including custom first payments.)
The graph provides a trend line for schedule‐generated payments (including custom first payments) over the last six
months.   Click on the mini‐graph to open a larger version. (Click the “close” button to close the large graph window.)
The schedule table displays 10 rows at a time, and lists the most recent schedules within the selected date range
first. Click the linked page numbers at the bottom of the table to navigate through the table results.
You can access edit, delete, suspend and resume functions from the Action menu for each schedule. To do this,
place your mouse over the Action box, then click on the function you want to perform from the menu.
NOTE: For “Expired” schedules, the Action button will not appear because no actions can be performed on recurring
payment schedules that have expired. You can view the schedule details by clicking the linked Schedule Id. (See
Viewing Recurring Payment Schedules below for instructions.)
The columns in the table are defined below, along with any sorting capability enabled for the column.
The Dashboard provides a report of all credit cards that will expire in the NEXT month
and that are attached to recurring payment schedules.
To view a report of all recurring payment schedules that have a credit card as the
payment method that will expire in the next 60 days, along with that credit card’s
expiration date, see Recurring Payments with Expiring Credit Cards Report in Chapter 7.

Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 133
Filter by Customer
The customer filter instructs the report to return only those schedules that were entered into ADP Payments for a
specific customer. The filter will not permit you to display schedules from multiple customers. For example, by
typing “Pell” into the box, you cannot return schedules for all customers with a last name of “Pell.”
The customer filter is a context‐sensitive search. This means that you can enter any three character part of a
customer’s first name, last name, or company name in the Search field, and the search will return all matches for
that string.   In the example shown below, the search string “pell” returned matches for a customers with a last name
of “Pell” as well as companies that have names containing “pell.”
NOTE: You can also enter the customer’s complete Customer ID in the Search field to locate the Customer Record.
Adaptive search does not work with Customer ID.   
Follow the steps below to create a customer filter:
1. Enter any 3 character or greater part of a customer’s first name, last name, company name or enter a
complete Customer ID in the Search field.
2. From the list of matches, click on the one you want to use as the filter.
3. The drop‐down box will close, and the table will be filtered based on the customer you selected.
To remove the customer filter, along with all other filter, click the “clear search” link in the top‐right of the search
navigation bar.
EXPORTING RECURRING PAYMENT SCHEDULES
You can export your recurring payment schedules as a .csv (comma delimited text) file that can be opened in Excel
for advanced reporting and charting, or can be imported into any other software system that accepts .csv imports.
The export file will contain all of the records included in the Recurring Payments table. Thus, to export a subset of
your transactions, first filter the table. For example:
• To export all of your schedules select “All” as the date filter.
• To export all schedules for a single customer, use the Customer filter. (See Filter by Customer above.)
• To export all “Active” schedules, use the Status filter. (See Filter by Schedule Status above.)
• To export all schedules starting on the current day, use the Date filter. (See Filter by Date Range above.)
The following sections describe how to export the file and define each column in the export.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 134
How to Export Recurring Payment Schedules
Follow the steps below to export your filtered payment history to a .csv file.
1. Go to the manage recurring payments screen.
2. Filter the table to define the data set for the export, or leave the default selection of all transactions.
3. Click the “export” link at the very top of the table, as shown:
4. Depending on your browser, you will have the option to open and/or save the file.
  a. To open the file, click the “Open” button in the dialog box. In most cases (unless you have your system
default .csv files to a different program), the file will open in Excel, but will not be saved. You will need
to save the file if you want to store it on your computer.
  b. To save the file to your computer:
When you export the recurring payment schedule file you will have a choice to open it
or to save it. If you select “open” the file will typically open in Excel. However, because
this is a .csv file Excel will often corrupt the data‐‐ for example by removing leading
zeros on routing numbers and zip codes.
If you want to use your export in Excel, the best practice is to save the .csv file to your
hard drive. Then open a new workbook in Excel and import the .csv file. During the
import process you can designate fieldssuch asrouting numbers, account numbers and
zip codes as “text” fields instead of number fields so that your data is not corrupted.
For detailed instructions on how to import .csv files into Excel, consult the Excel Help
files.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 135
  i. Click the “Save” button in the dialog box.   
  ii. A Save As dialog box opens.
NOTE: In Google Chrome, and some other browsers, clicking the “csv” link will automatically save
the file to your Downloads folder. You can open it from the browser “Downloads” bar or access it
from the Downloads folder later.
  iii. Enter a name for your file, and select a location on your computer where you want to save the file.
  iv. Click the “Save” button.
  v. You can now open the export at any time, or import it into an Excel file or other application
software.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 136

EDITING RECURRING PAYMENT SCHEDULES
All payment schedules can be edited prior to the schedule Start Date. If a schedule has not started, you can change
any of its components. If the custom first payment has not yet executed, you can make changes to it as well.
NOTE: If the custom first payment has been made, but the schedule Start Date is in the future, you can make
changes to all parts of the schedule except custom first payment fields.
Recurring Billing schedules can also be edited once they have started, and you can change all schedule settings
except for customer, Schedule Id and custom first payment settings.
Once a Payment Plan schedule has started it cannot be edited. However you can change the payment account
attached to the Payment Plan schedule by deleting the original account and replacing it with a new one.
The following sections provide detailed instructions for editing recurring payment schedules.
Editing Recurring Payment Schedules that Have Not Started

NOTE: When you make a change to the amount, frequency, or payment account on a recurring payment schedule
your customer will be sent an email confirming the change. Changes to other areas such as email templates, invoice
number or email addresses will not result in a change email being sent.
The email sent is “Edited Recurring Schedule‐‐Bill Payment” for recurring billing schedules. (See Email Preferences
and Templates in Chapter 8 for instructions on how to edit email templates.)
Changing the Payment Account for Payment Plan Schedules
Once a Payment Plan schedule is activated, the payment method (credit card or ACH) cannot be changed. However,
you can change the specific account billed by the schedule.
NOTE: For Recurring Billing schedules the method described below can be used to change a payment account, but
NOT a payment method. However, you can use the edit function (See Editing Recurring Billing Schedules that Have
Started) to change the payment method and/or the payment account for Recurring Billing schedules that have
started.
    
Follow these steps to change the payment account for a Payment Plan schedule:
NOTE: The following example uses Credit Card as the Payment Method. The process is identical when ACH (e‐check)
is the Payment Method.
1. Open the Customer Record in edit mode for the customer whose schedule you want to change, and scroll
down to the payment accounts section at the bottom of the screen. (See Managing Customer Payment
Accounts in Chapter 6.)
2. Click the “delete” link next to the card currently attached to the schedule.
NOTE: The only way to replace a payment account on a schedule that has started is to delete it. After you
have assigned a new account you can re‐enter the original card if you still have the full account number.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 145
3. The credit card delete confirmation pop‐up appears. Click “ok” to delete the card, or “cancel” to keep it
4. The change account pop‐up window appears. From the drop‐down box, select the credit card you would
like to use in recurring payment schedules instead of the card being deleted. (Or click the “cancel” button to
discard the delete.)
NOTE: If the account is attached to more than one schedule this will replace it in all of them. There is no
way to replace a payment account in one schedule and leave it attached to another.
5. Click the “submit” button to save the change.
6. A pop‐up window will appear confirming that the credit card has been deleted.
7. Click “ok” to close the pop‐up and return to the Edit Customer Details screen.  All future payments
processed via the schedule will use the new account.
You cannot delete a credit card that is attached to a recurring payment schedule and
assign a bank account as the replacement payment account. Nor can you delete a bank
account that is attached to a recurring payment schedule and assign a credit card as the
replacement account.
If you want to change a Payment Plan schedule from a credit card to a bank account, or
vice versa, you need to “suspend” the original schedule, and then enter a new one
using the new Payment Method. (See Entering Recurring Billing Schedules.)
If you want to change a Recurring Billing schedule from a credit card to a bank account,
or vice versa, you need to use the “Edit” schedule function. (See Editing Recurring
Billing Schedules that Have Started.)
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 146
SUSPENDING/RESUMING RECURRING PAYMENT SCHEDULES
You cannot delete a recurring payment schedule from ADP Payments once it has started. However, you can suspend
it so that it no longer generates new transactions. To suspend a recurring payment schedule:
1. Locate the schedule you want to Suspend in the Recurring Payments table.
2. Click the Action button then click the “Suspend” link, as shown below.
NOTE: You will only see this option if the schedule is “Active.”
NOTE: You can also access the Suspend function while viewing schedule details (see Viewing Recurring
Payment Schedules) by clicking the “suspend schedule” link at the top‐right of the screen.
3. A pop‐up window will open in which you configure the suspension settings.
• To suspend the schedule indefinitely, leave the “Suspend indefinitely” radio button selected.  If you
select this option, the schedule will remain “suspended” and will not generate any payments until you
manually turn it back on.
• To suspend the schedule until a specific date, select the “Suspend until a specific date” radio button
then place your mouse in the field to open the calendar. Click on the date you want the schedule to
automatically resume, or simply type the date in the field. If you select this option the schedule status
will automatically change back to “Active” on the date you indicate.
NOTE: If you want to resume the schedule prior to the date you selected, you can do that manually.
You cannot directly change the resume date on a “Suspended” schedule. You must first “Resume” the
schedule, then “Suspend” it again and enter the new resume date.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 147
4. The Status of the schedule is changed to “Suspended” and the Next payment date field will be blank if you
suspended the schedule indefinitely, or will contain a Next payment date based on the resume date. For
example, in the schedule shown below the schedule Frequency is the first of each month, and as we
suspended it until October 31, 2011 in the previous step, the Next payment date is November 1, 2011.
NOTE: Click the question mark next to the “Suspended” status to see the resume date for the schedule.
Once a recurring payment schedule has been “Suspended,” either indefinitely or until a specific date, you can turn it
back on manually at any time. To do this:
1. Locate the schedule you want to Resume in the Recurring Payments table.
2. Click the Action button then click the “Resume Recurring Billing” link, as shown below.
NOTE: You will only see this option if the schedule is “Suspended.”
NOTE: You can also access the Resume function while viewing schedule details for a suspended schedule
(see Viewing Recurring Payment Schedules) by clicking the “resume schedule” link at the top‐right of the
screen.
3. You will now see the Status of the schedule changed to “Active” and the date the next payment on the
schedule will be processed will now be in the Next payment date column.
Each time you suspend or resume a recurring payment schedule your customer will
receive an email confirming the change. The email will include the current status of the
schedule, and will also include the next payment date for the schedule.
See Appendix D: Email Templates for a detailed inventory of system email templates,
and see Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for instructions on how to add
and edit email templates.
Chapter 4: Payments : Managing Recurring Payments 148
If you suspend a recurring billing schedule and do not reactivate it prior to a
programmed End date, you will no longer see the “Resume recurring billing” link in the
Action menu.
To resume the schedule, first edit it and change the End date to a future date. After
saving the change, the resume functionality will be available again.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 149
Importing Recurring Payment Schedules
There are two types of Recurring Payment imports:
• Existing Customers (with Customer IDs).
For these import files, you provide the ADP Payments Customer ID, the schedule details, and the type
of payment, and the system creates the schedule using the default account for the payment method
selected.
• New Customers (without Customer IDs).
For these import files, all required fields for a customer and all required fields for a payment schedule
must be provided and mapped.
The following things occur once the imported schedules are saved and activated:
1. Your customer receives an email notifying them that a new schedule has been entered. (See Email
Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for detailed information on viewing and editing email templates.
See Appendix D: Email Templates for a full inventory of the email templates included in your system.)
• The default email template for a Recurring Billing schedule is “New Recurring Schedule‐‐Bill Payment.”
• The default email template for a Payment Plan schedule is “New Recurring Schedule‐‐Payment Plan.”
2. If a scheduled transaction is set to occur on the current day, that transaction is processed immediately.  You
will see the transaction recorded in the transaction table in the manage payments screen.  
• The system will email a receipt for the payment.
NOTE: If you do not include an email address for a customer, the payment will still be processed but
the new schedule notification and receipts will not be sent.
3. You will see the new schedule in the manage recurring payments screen. If the Start date is in the future,
you will be able to edit the schedule. (See Editing Recurring Payment Schedules.)
NOTE: For your first few recurring payment imports, you may want to schedule start dates in the future so
that you can review the schedules and correct any errors after the import is complete.
Detailed field requirements for recurring payment imports, as well as all ADP Payments imports, can be found in
Appendix C: Import Requirements.
The following sections cover how to import recurring payment schedules for new and existing customers. (For more
information on the ADP Payments Import Center, and batch status and error reporting, see Import Center in Chapter
8.)
You can use a single Recurring Payment import file to upload Recurring Billing and
Payment Plan schedules for new and existing customers. To do this, make certain that
your file contains all of the required fields for both schedule types, and for both new
and existing customers.
Each new customer row must contain data in each of the required fields for a new
customer recurring payment import. Each existing customer row must contain data in
all of the required fields for an existing customer recurring payment import.
Make sure you map all fields when importing your file. The system will simply ignore
empty fields where they are not applicable.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 150
IMPORTING RECURRING PAYMENT SCHEDULES FOR NEW
CUSTOMERS
When a Recurring Payment import file is processed by ADP Payments the system creates a new Customer Record
and assigns a Customer ID for each customer in the file, and it creates a new recurring payment schedule for the
customer.   The initial scheduled transaction is processed immediately if the Start Date of the schedule is the current
date.   
After the initial import, you can process additional payments for the imported customers from the Payments center
or via another payment import using the assigned Customer ID.
Follow these basic steps to import a Recurring Payment file for new customers into ADP Payments:
1. Create your Recurring Payment import file.
2. Upload the file into ADP Payments on the Settings‐‐> import center screen.
3. Map fields from your file to ADP Payments system fields.
4. Review your file mapping.
5. Submit the Recurring Payment import file for processing.
6. View the results of the import.
The following sections walk you through all of these steps.
Creating a Recurring Payment Import File for New Customers
ADP Payments import files must be in .csv (comma delimited text) format or pipe delimited text format. All fields,
including date fields, must be formatted as text fields. All credit card account numbers must also be entered without
any dashes or spaces.
You can use column headers in your file if you like. (You can also upload files without headers.) You do not need to
use the ADP Payments field names in your header row. Use field names you will easily recognize, as you will be
mapping these fields to ADP Payments system fields during the import process.
For more information on proper formatting of ADP Payments import files, see Appendix C: Import Requirements.
(For details specific to Recurring Payment imports, see Recurring Payment Import Requirements in Appendix )
When creating new customers and recurring payment schedules via an Import file you can include any fields
available in the Customer Record, as well as all fields available for entering Recurring Billing and Payment Plan
schedules. (For a complete list and description of all fields available in a new customer Recurring Payment import
see Recurring Payment Import Requirements for New Customers.)
Do not use commas in any of the fields when creating a .csv import file.  Doing so will
corrupt your data and cause values to be mapped to the wrong fields.  For example,
you should never enter a company name as “ABC Company, Inc.”  Instead, enter “ABC
Company Inc.”
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 151
The following fields are required for all Recurring Payment import files containing new customers:
• First Name
• Last Name
• Billing Address 1
• City
• State/Province
• Zip/Postal Code
NOTE: If you do not map the Country field, or if the row does not contain a value for it, the field will
default to “USA.”
• Payment Type (Enter “ACH” or “CC”)
• If Payment Type = “ACH” then ACH Type is also a required field. Enter “PPD” “CCD” or “WEB.” (See
Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions for more information on ACH Types.)
NOTE: If you enter “CCD” asthe ACH Type, you must also enter a Company Name for the customer,
or the schedule will fail.
• Payment account information fields as follows:
• Credit Card Accounts
•Credit Card Number (no dashes or spaces)
•Card Type: Enter "AMEX" or “Visa" or "Master" or “Discover."
•Expiration Date (MM/YY)
• Bank Accounts
•Account Type: Enter “Checking” or “Savings”
•Bank Name
•Bank Account Number
•Routing Number
• Schedule Type: Enter “Bill Payment” or “Payment Plan.”
• If “Bill Payment” enter payment Amount.
• If “Payment Plan” enter Total Due and Number of Payments.
• Frequency: Enter “Daily” or “Weekly” or “Every Other Week” or “First of Month” or “Last of Month”
or “Specific Day of Month” or “Quarterly” or “Semi Annually” or “Annually.”
• For “Weekly” and “Every other Week” include “Day of Week” field. Enter “Monday” or “Tuesday”
or “Wednesday” or “Thursday” or “Friday” or “Saturday” or “Sunday.”
• For “Specific Day of Month” also include “Day of Month” field.  Enter a number between 1 and 31.
• Schedule Start Date (mm/dd/yyyy)
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 152
The easiest way to create and save your Recurring Payment import file is to create it in Excel then export it as a .csv
file. To do this, use the “save as” function in Excel, and select “comma delimited csv” as the file type.
Uploading a Recurring Payment Import File for New Customers
Once you have created your Recurring Payment import file, follow these steps to import it into ADP Payments:
1. Go to the ADP Payments Import Center. Do one of the following:
  a. Click the “import” link at the top of the Recurring Payments table, as shown:
  b. Click the “Settings” link in top navigation, then click on the “Import Center” tab.
2. The Import Center dashboard screen opens, as shown below. (For more information on the Import Center
dashboard see Import Center Dashboard in Chapter 8.)
Once you save an Excel file as a .csv file, it is very important that you do not open or
edit the .csv file in Excel prior to importing it into ADP Payments. Doing this will corrupt
the file and cause import errors.
If you need to make a change to the data in your Recurring Payment import file, open
the Excel file, make any changes required, then use the “save as” function to save the
edited file in .csv format.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 153
3. In the Import type field drop‐down box, select “Recurring payment.”
4. Enter a short descriptive name for your import in the Import name field.  This name will be used when
referencing this particular import batch in tables on the Import Center dashboard.
5. Enter a short description of the import in the Import description field. (Optional)
6. In the File type drop‐down box select the type of file you will be importing.  You can use a .csv file
(recommended) or a pipe‐delimited text file.
7. If the file you are importing contains a header row, check the First row is header checkbox. (Using a header
row is very helpful for the field mapping that you will perform in Step 11.)   If there is no header row, leave
this box unchecked.
8. Click the “Choose File” button to locate the import batch file on your computer.
9. Click the “upload” button to begin the import process.
10. The system will perform a preliminary validation of your file. If it is corrupt or unusable, you will see an
error message. Otherwise, you will see the Map Field Titles screen, shown below:    
• The first column displays the values in the first row of each column in your file. These will either be the
values in your header row, or the first row of data (if your file does not contain a header row).
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 154
• The second column contains drop‐down boxes used to map fields in your file to ADP Payments system
fields.
• The Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box enables you to select a saved mapping schema. (See
About Saved Mapping Schemes in Chapter 8 for instructions on using saved mappings.)
• The “reset mapping” button will clear all values in the System Field Names drop‐down boxes so that
you can begin the mapping process again.
• The help box, located under the “reset mapping” button provides definitions for all of the ADP
Payments system fields. Select a field name from the drop‐down, and its definition will appear under
the box.
11. For each column you want to map from your file, select a corresponding ADP Payments field from the
associated drop‐down box, as shown below. If you do not want to map a field from your file, leave the
corresponding drop‐down box set to “‐Select Column‐.”
NOTE: Fields that you select will disappear from the list of available fields. This prevents you from
accidentally creating duplicate mappings.   
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 155
12. When you have finished mapping fields it should look something like the sample below. Click the
“continue” button.
13. On the next screen, shown below, enter a name for the mapping you just created in the Mapping Name
field. You can select this mapping at a later date from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box to quickly
map a file using the same column structure.
NOTE: You are required to save your mapping. Even if you never expect to use it again, storing it will save
time if there is an error processing your import and you need to upload your file again.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 156
   
14. Enter a Description for the mapping.  (Optional)
15. Click the “save and continue” button.
16. The Approve File Import For Processing screen appears, as shown below:   
• The top line (in white) contains the ADP Payments system field names, in alphabetical order.
• The second line (in purple) appears only if your file has a header row, and contains the field names in
that header row.
• The following 5 lines (in white) contain the first 5 data rows from your file. You can scroll through them
in the table.
NOTE: Credit card numbers are encrypted immediately upon being uploaded into ADP Payments, so
you will only see the last four digits of a credit card number in the table.
17. Double check that your mapping correctly matched fields in your file to ADP Payments system fields.
  a. If you see an error, click the “back to mapping” button to return to the mapping screen (Step 11.),
correct any errors, and proceed.
  b. When you’re satisfied with the mapping, click the “approve batch” button.
18. When the file is successfully uploaded and queued for processing, you’ll see an on‐screen file approval
message as shown below. (If there are errors you’ll see an on‐screen message indicating the corrections
that need to be made.)

19. Click the “import center” link to return to the Import Center dashboard and view the status of your file.
20. Continue with Viewing Results from a Recurring Payment Import.
IMPORTING RECURRING PAYMENT SCHEDULES FOR EXISTING
CUSTOMERS
With ADP Payments you can upload recurring payment schedules for existing customers by referencing their ADP
Payments Customer ID, without having to upload their bank account and credit card information each time. This
means that you can enter account information into ADP Payments once and let the system securely store that
information for use in future payments and schedules so you do not need to retain that information in your own
systems.
When ADP Payments processes an imported recurring payment schedule for an existing customer, the system uses
the customer’s default credit card for credit card transactions and the customer's default bank account for echeck
(ACH) transactions.
The default credit card account is indicated by a check in the Default column in the Credit Card accounts table in the
Customer Record. The default bank account is indicated by a check in the Default column in the echeck (ACH)
accounts table in the Customer Record. (See About Default Payment Accounts in Chapter 6.)
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 158
You can locate the Customer ID for any customer by editing or viewing a Customer Record. The Customer ID is
located at the very top of the Customer Details or Edit Customer screen, as shown:
You can also export your entire customer list including the Customer ID for each customer. (See Exporting the
Customer List in Chapter 6 for instructions.)
Follow these basic steps to import a recurring payment file for existing customers into ADP Payments:
1. Locate the Customer ID for each of the customers for which you want to process a payment.
2. Create your Recurring Payment import file.
3. Upload the file into ADP Payments on the Settings‐‐> Import Center screen.
4. Map fields from your file to ADP Payments system fields.
5. Review your file mapping.
6. Submit the Recurring Payment import file for processing.
7. View the results of the import.
The following sections walk you through all of these steps.
If you want to use an account other than the default bank account or credit card for an
imported schedule, you can manually change the account after the import by editing
the schedule.
However, you can only do this if you program the schedule Start Date for a future day.
If the schedule Start Date is set to the current date, you will not be able to edit it, and
the default account on file will be permanently attached to the schedule.
Alternately, you can set the credit card account you want to use as the Default account
just prior to importing the batch. You can then switch back to the original Default
account without affecting the schedule. (See About Default Payment Accounts in
Chapter 6 for instructions on setting and changing default payment accounts.)
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 159
Creating a Recurring Payment Import File for Existing Customers
ADP Payments import files must be in .csv (comma delimited text) format or pipe delimited text format. All fields,
including date fields, must be formatted as text fields. All credit card account numbers must also be entered without
any dashes or spaces.
You can use column headers in your file if you like. (You can also upload files without headers.) You do not need to
use the ADP Payments field names in your header row. Use field names you will easily recognize, since you will be
mapping these fields to ADP Payments system fields during the import process.
For more information on proper formatting of ADP Payments import files, see Appendix C: Import Requirements.
(For details specific to Recurring Payment Imports, see Recurring Payment Import Requirements in Appendix )
NOTE: You can include as many fields as you like in the import file, but the system will only import data for the fields
you map to ADP Paymentssystem fields. Thissavestime when exporting data from anothersystem,since you do not
need to filter the data prior to importing the file into ADP Payments.
Only the following required and optional fields are available in Recurring Payment import files for existing
customers. (See Recurring Payment Import Requirements for Existing Customers for details.)
• Required Fields
• Customer ID
• Payment Type (Enter “ACH” or “CC”)
• If Payment Type = “ACH”, then ACH Type is also a required field. Enter “PPD” “CCD” or “WEB”
(See Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions for more information on ACH Types.)
NOTE: If you enter “CCD” as the ACH Type, there must be a Company Name included in the
Customer Record, or the schedule will fail.
• Schedule Type: Enter “Bill Payment” or “Payment Plan.”
• If “Bill Payment” enter payment Amount.
• If “Payment Plan” enter Total Due and Number of Payments.
• Frequency: Enter “Daily” or “Weekly” or “Every Other Week” or “First of Month” or “Last of
Month” or “Specific Day of Month” or “Quarterly” or “Semi Annually” or “Annually.”
• For “Weekly” and “Every other Week” include “Day of Week” field.  Enter “Monday” or
“Tuesday” or “Wednesday” or “Thursday” or “Friday” or “Saturday” or “Sunday.”
• For “Specific Day of Month” include “Day of Month” field.  Enter a number between 1 and 31.
• Schedule Start Date (mm/dd/yyyy)
When importing recurring payment schedules for existing customers you cannot use
the import to make changes to existing values in a Customer Record. Any changes you
make to Customer Record fields will be ignored if you provide and map a Customer ID
in your import row.
For example, if for Customer ID 1234 the system shows a first name of “Bobby,” you
cannot change that to “Robert” by entering “Robert” in the “First Name” field of an
existing customer Recurring Payment import file.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 160
• Optional Fields
• Invoice number   
• P.O. Number
• Description
• End Date (mm/dd/yyyy)‐‐ for use with “Bill Payment” schedules only.
NOTE: If you do not enter an End Date for a Bill Payment schedule, the schedule will be entered
with no end date‐‐ it will run indefinitely or until you manually suspend it.
• Custom First Payment Amount and Custom First Payment Date (you must use both or neither).
A sample existing customer Recurring Payment import file created in Excel is shown below:
NOTE: The First Name and Last Name columns are for reference purposes. They will not be mapped as part of the
import into ADP Payments.
The easiest way to create and save your Recurring Payment import file is to create it in Excel then export it as a .csv
file. To do this, use the “save as” function in Excel, and select “comma delimited csv” as the file type.

VIEWING RESULTS FROM A RECURRING PAYMENT IMPORT
After a successful file import, you will see your file in one of the Import Center Tables. (See Import Center
Dashboard in Chapter 8 for details on this screen.)
• Imports Queued for Processing: If your file is in this table, it is waiting to be processed. Check back
later for a final status.
• Imports Needing Attention: All or part of the file has been processed. Click the “View Errors” link to
view problems. (See Troubleshooting Import Batch Errors in Chapter 8 for how to troubleshoot “Needs
Attention” batches.)
• Processing Imports: Your file is currently being processed by the system.
Completed Imports (shown below): Your file has been processed by the system and all rows were successfully
imported and all schedules and customers were added.   
If your import was successful, you should see schedules recorded for all rows in the file in the manage recurring
payments screen. (See The Recurring Payments Table above.) All payments scheduled for the current day will be
included in the Payments table. (See The Payments Table above.)
For new customer Recurring Payment import files, you should see new Customer Records created for each customer
in your file. You can now enter additional recurring payment schedules for these customers in addition to entering
one‐time payments, invoices, and invoice schedules for them‐‐ exactly as you would with customers manually
entered into ADP Payments.
Chapter 4: Payments : Importing Recurring Payment Schedules 166
If there were errors in a new customer Recurring Payment import file related to
entering the schedule or processing the initial payment on the schedule, the file will be
listed in the Imports Needing Attention section of the Import Center dashboard. It will
appear as though the entire row did not get processed.
However, in some cases ADP Payments will have created a new Customer Record for
that row in the file even though the system did not create a schedule.
Before re‐importing the row, be sure to check the Customers section to see if a
Customer Record was created.
Chapter 5: Invoices 167
Chapter 5:  Invoices
From the Invoices center you can enter new invoices, as well as enter new recurring invoice schedules, and create
invoice Line Items and item lists. Your complete invoice history is accessible from the manage invoices tab, and your

  i. Click the “mark as sent” link to indicate that your customer has received the invoice, whether or
not the system has actually emailed it.
NOTE: This is a good option to use if you print invoices in advance and then mail or otherwise
deliver them to your customers on the actual invoice date outside of ADP Payments. However,
when you do this, the system will immediately show that the invoices have been sent (by assigning
a status of “Unpaid (Sent)”) instead of updating the status on the actual invoice send date.
  ii. A pop‐up window will appear asking you to confirm that you want to save the invoice and mark it
as “sent.” Click the “mark as sent” button to mark the invoice as sent, or the “cancel” button to
return to the invoice without taking any action.

navigation.
2. Select or enter the Customer to load. (See Loading and Entering Customers for New Invoices and Schedules
above.)
3. Leave the invoice number field as it is, it will be ignored for the schedule.
NOTE: If you have enabled auto‐numbering the invoice will be assigned the Next invoice number available
when it is generated.
If you do not have auto‐numbering available (the Invoice number field will be blank when you open the
Send new invoice screen), the invoice will be assigned an invoice number using the format of “RECURS‐
Schedule ID‐‐System invoice ID” as shown below in an excerpt from an invoice email.
4. P.O. number: If your customer issued a P.O. number for this schedule, include it here. It will be included on
all invoice emails sent to the customer. This is an optional field. (Maximum 50 characters.)
Chapter 5: Invoices : New Invoices and Invoice Schedules 195
5. The Invoice date field defaults to the current date. Leave this default setting as is, it will be saved as the
schedule enter date.
6. Select the Payment terms for this invoice. Do one of the following:
  a. Select existing Payment terms by clicking the down arrow on the Payment terms drop‐down box, and
clicking on the terms you want to apply, as shown below:
  i. The Due Date will initially be displayed to the right of the Payment terms drop‐down box, based
on the selection you made.   Once you select “Recurs” as the schedule type, in the next step, the
Due Date will disappear. Each invoice generated as part of a schedule will have the due date
calculated based on the Payment terms you select here.
NOTE: Do not use the “Select due date” feature in the Payment terms drop‐down box. If you do,
your selection will be cleared, and you will need to select relative Payment terms, in order to
create and save the schedule.
  b. Enter new Payment terms.
  i. Click the “create new term” item in the Payment terms drop‐down box list.
NOTE: You can also create and delete Payment Terms from the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐>
Payment Terms & Taxesscreen. You cannot delete Payment Termsfrom the drop‐down box on the
send new invoice screen. (See Payment Terms in Chapter 8 for instructions.)
  ii. The Create a new payment term screen opens, as shown below:
You will not see a DUE DATE displayed on an invoice schedule. When ADP Payments
generates each individual invoice in the schedule, it will insert the DUE DATE field and
calculate the date based on the invoice send date and the Payment terms you enter.
Chapter 5: Invoices : New Invoices and Invoice Schedules 196
  iii. Enter a description of the payment term in the Payment term description field. This will only
appear in the Payment term drop‐down list. Your customer will not see this description.
  iv. Select one of the pre‐programmed terms, or enter your own by selecting the last radio button, and
entering a number of days for the term.
For example, in the above screen capture we are creating a payment term of Net 45 days, so the
last “Payment due” radio button is selected, and “45” is entered in the days field.
  v. Click the “save and select” button to create the new payment term and use it for the schedule you
are creating.
7. Select “Recurs” in the invoice type drop‐down box to expand the schedule settings section, and configure

• Specific day of month‐‐‐ A new drop‐down box will appear in which you should select the day of
the month on which to send the invoice.
NOTE: If you want to send invoices on the 30th or the 31st, select the “Last of month” option
instead of the “Specific day of month” option to avoid confusion in short months like February.
• Last of month
• Quarterly‐‐ If you select this option, the system will send an invoice every 3 months on the day of
the month used for the schedule start date.
• Semi‐Annually‐‐ If you select this option, the system will send an invoice every 6 months on the
day of the month used for the schedule start date.
• Annually‐‐ If you select this option, the system will send and invoice every year on the month and

changing the saved values for the item.
  iii. The Qty field will automatically be set to “1.” Change this value to the appropriate number for the
invoice, as required.
  iv. In the Tax 1 drop‐down box, select a Tax that will be applied to this Line Item, as shown below.
(See Terms & Taxes in Chapter 8 for how to enter and edit tax rates.) If you do not make a
selection, then no tax will be applied to this Line Item.
NOTE: The tax amount will be calculated based on the Amount less any discount. For example, if
the tax rate is 10%, the Discount is 10%, and the Amount is $100 the taxable amount for the line
item will be $9.00‐‐ (100 ‐ 10) * 0.10 = 9
You can also enter a new tax rate by selecting “add new item” from the Tax 1 (or Tax 2)
drop‐down box. This will open a pop‐up window, shown below, from which you can
enter the Tax Name and the Rate.
When you click the “save and select” button the new rate will be applied to the current
Line Item, saved, and will be included in the Tax drop‐down boxes going forward. It can
also be edited and deleted from the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐>terms & taxes screen.   
(See Tax Rates in Chapter 8)
Chapter 5: Invoices : New Invoices and Invoice Schedules 199
  v. In the Tax 2 drop‐down box, select a second tax that will be applied to the Line Item, if applicable.
Note that the tax will be calculated based on the total cost of the items only, not on the cost of the
items plus Tax 1.
  vi. The Amount field for the Line Item will now reflect the total amount for the items not including
taxes. i.e. Qty x Price = Amount.
  vii. Enter additional Line Items by clicking the “add another line” link and repeating steps i‐vi.
  viii.Delete Line Items by clicking the “x” on the far left side of the Line Item.

  iv. Your invoice will now be populated with the saved Line Items programmed for the list, including
quantities and taxes and Amount, as shown below:
If you have individual Line Items entered into an invoice, and you then load a “saved list
of items,” the individual Line Items will be overwritten by the saved list.
However, you can load a “saved list of items” FIRST, and then ADD additional individual
Line Items to the invoice as well as make changes to the Line Items loaded from the
Saved List.
Chapter 5: Invoices : New Invoices and Invoice Schedules 200
9. In the DISCOUNT field, enter the percentage discount you want to provide off the invoice total. The same
discount will be used for all invoices in the schedule. You can enter any number between 0.01 and 99.99.
For example to provide a 2 and a half percent discount, enter 2.5 (do not enter .025). The default Discount
is 0%. If you enter a Discount, an additional line will be added to the invoice for the discount, as shown:
10. The SUBTOTAL, Taxes and DISCOUNT fields, as shown above, will be calculated based on the Line Items.
• SUBTOTAL = The sum of all Goods and Services, excluding Tax and Discount.
• The DISCOUNT applied to the invoice will be on its own line and shown as a negative dollar value. The
DISCOUNT percentage is indicated in parenthesis.
• Each Tax applied will have its own line on the invoice. The Tax name will be listed first, the tax
percentage or flat amount will be next to it in parenthesis, and the total tax charged will be displayed.
11. The TOTAL DUE field is calculated based on the total of all Line Items and taxes less any discount.
(SUBTOTAL + TAXES ‐ DISCOUNT)
12. The Note for customer field, shown below, is a text area which enables you to include a note to your
customer on the invoice. There is a 2000 character limit for this field.
• If you entered a system Note for customer in the Customer note field on the Settings ‐‐>
Configuration‐‐> Preferences screen, that text will appear in the Note for customer field. You can
make changes to this field for any individual invoice without changing the system‐wide setting. (See
Preferences in Chapter 8.)
• You can click the “Set default” link to set the default system Note for customer. When you click the
link, a pop‐up window will open as shown below, and the current system‐wide note text will appear in
the field.
You can enter or change the text, and when you click the “save” button the new default will be placed
in the current open invoice. It will also be saved in the Customer note field on the Settings ‐‐>
Configuration‐‐> Preferences screen, and will be used as the default on all future invoices.
NOTE: The system will not pick up the text entered in the Note for customer field in the invoice you are
working on at the time you click the “Set default” link. If you want to use that text as the default, copy
it prior to clicking the “Set default” link then paste it in the field.

NOTE: There is an additional charge for each mailed invoice, and you will need to
purchase snail mail credits in order to use this feature. If you do not have sufficient
credits to send the invoice when it is generated by the scheduler, it will not be sent via
mail, and you will see an alert message on your Dashboard and receive an email notifying
you of the error. However, if you also selected the E‐mail option, it will still be sent via
email. (See Snail Mail Credits in Chapter 8 for details.)
Chapter 5: Invoices : New Invoices and Invoice Schedules 202
   2• The E‐mail recipients section is only visible when the E‐mail box is checked. Use this section to control to
whom the email is sent, and the items included in the email.

system to do this. Go to the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐>Email preferences and
templates screen, and in the INVOICES section select the “Yes, cc me on all invoices”
radio button. You can also change the address to which this email is sent from that
screen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8.)
• Checking the Attach invoice as a PDF file box will instruct the system to attach a .pdf
version of the invoice to the email sent to your customer. This will enable the customer to
view and save the invoice directly from the email, even if they are not connected to the
Internet.
NOTE: The “click here” link and the “pay invoice now” button in the invoice email opens
your Customer Portal log‐in screen. Your customers can log‐into Customer Portal to view
the invoice and make a payment (or download a .pdf version of the invoice). They can
also view the invoice online and pay it as a guest (or download the .pdf as a guest) if you
have configured your system to accept guest payments. (See Invoice Settings in Chapter 8
for how to configure this setting.)
  iii. The bottom portion of the screen contains a preview of the invoice Subject and Message, and is
view only. Changes can’t be made from this screen. It displays the text message that will be sent
with the invoice. The email is always sent to your customer’s default email address, which is

SAMPLE INVOICE EMAIL
Your customer will receive an email notification for each invoice entered for them, whether one‐time or part of an
invoice schedule. Depending on how you configure your invoices and schedules, the invoice email will provide basic
details about the invoice (such as Invoice # and total due), will display a condensed version of the invoice below the
introductory text (including line items, taxes, discounts, payments made, and balance due), and will include a “pay
invoice now button” that will enable your customers to log‐into Customer Portal to view the invoice and make a
payment (or download a .pdf version of the invoice), or to view the invoice online and pay it as a guest (or download
the .pdf as a guest) if you have configured your system to accept guest payments. (See Invoice Settings in Chapter 8
for how to configure this setting.)
NOTE: The invoice email and the .pdf version of the invoice will have a logo at the bottom identifying ADP Payments
as the secure invoicing provider.
You can also elect to attach the .pdf version of the invoice to the email itself. (See New Invoices and Invoice
Schedules for how to configure invoice email settings.)

button, as shown below:
Chapter 5: Invoices : New Invoices and Invoice Schedules 209
You can customize the following components in the invoice PDF, and in the corresponding online version your
customers see when they click to pay the invoice. See Preferences in Chapter 8 for how to configure these
customizations.
• Logo
• Contact information
• Comment
NOTE: You can set a global comment from the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐>Preferences screen. You can
also edit the global comment, or enter a new comment, from the Note to customer field in the send
new invoice screen on an invoice‐by‐invoice basis.
NOTE: These are also the customizations that will be used to create your Customer Portal log‐in screen,
pictured below.
The log‐in screen for Customer Portal your customers see after clicking a “Pay Invoice Now” button will be co‐
branded for your company, and will look something like this:
Your customers can decide whether to login to Customer Portal to make a payment, or pay the invoice without
creating a Customer Portal account.
NOTE: If you do not configure your ADP Payments account to enable invoice payment without logging in, then this
option will not be available, and the “view and pay invoice as guest” link will not appear.
When you resend invoice emails they will reflect the current status of the invoice, as
well as any payments made on it. For example, in this screen capture the invoice has a
status of “Paid (partial)” and the $45 payment as well as the $45 balance are displayed.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 210
Managing Invoices
The manage invoices tab in the Invoices center, shown below, provides access to all invoices generated in your ADP
Payments account. This includes one‐time invoices you create manually, as well as individual invoices created
automatically by recurring invoice schedules.
From the manage invoices tab you can view all invoices, and filter views by status, send date or customer. You can
also collect payments for outstanding invoices, mark invoices paid and/or sent, cancel or delete invoices, print
invoices, edit unpaid invoices, and even resend an outstanding invoice to a customer.
The following sections provide instructions for performing all of these tasks.
MANAGING INDIVIDUAL INVOICES
When you click on the manage invoices tab, the default screen view displays a table report of invoices in your ADP
Payments system created in the last 30 days, as shown below. This list contains both one‐time invoices you entered
manually, and invoices generated automatically by ADP Payments based on a recurring invoice schedule you
created.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 211
The snapshot at the top right of the screen displays the total dollar value of invoices due in the current month‐‐ 
regardless of whether they have been paid or are still outstanding. Click the linked dollar value to display the
payments included in that total in the table below.
The graphs provides a trend line for invoiced dollars over the last six months. Click on a mini‐graph to open a larger
version. Click the “close” button on the large graph to close it.
The invoice table displays 10 rows at a time, and by default lists the most recently created invoices first. When you
create a filter to view a specific date range, it will display the newest invoices within the date range first. Click the
linked page numbers at the bottom of the table to navigate through the table results.
You can access mark as paid, mark as sent, collect a payment, resend, cancel, view, delete, edit, download, print and
copy functions from the Action menu for each invoice. To do this, click the Action button, then click on the function
you want to perform from the menu.
You can click any of the column headers to re‐sort the table results based on that column, as follows:
• Status‐‐ Sorts the transactions by Status. The sort order is alphabetical. Click once to sort from A‐to‐Z,
click again to sort from Z‐to‐A.
Each Status has two components. The first is the main component which indicates the status of the
invoice itself. Invoice Status values are defined as follows:
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 212
• Paid‐‐ The invoice has been paid.
• Paid (partial)‐‐ The invoice has been partially paid.
NOTE: You will only see this status if you have enabled your system to accept partial payments of
invoices.
• Unpaid‐‐The invoice has not been paid, and the Due date has not yet passed.
• Draft‐‐The invoice has been saved, but not yet activated and sent to your customer.
• Cancelled‐‐ The invoice was cancelled and will not be paid.
• Past Due‐‐The invoice has not been paid, and the Due date has passed.
NOTE: “Paid (partial)” invoices will update status to “Past Due” if the invoice has not been
completely discharged prior to the invoice Due Date.
The second component indicates whether the invoice has been sent to your customer (or was
manually marked as sent).
• (Sent)‐‐ The invoice was emailed to the customer or manually marked as sent.
• (Unsent)‐‐ The invoice was not sent to the customer.
• Invoice #‐‐ Sorts the invoices alpha‐numerically by the Inv. #. If auto‐numbering is enabled, this is the
number assigned when the invoice was created. If auto‐numbering is not enabled, for one‐time
invoices this is the alpha‐numeric invoice number you entered when you created the invoice; and for
invoices generated by invoice schedules, the invoice numbers are in the format of “RECURS‐‐Schedule
ID‐‐system invoice ID.” Click once to sort low‐to‐high, click again to sort high‐to‐low.
NOTE: The system displays only the first 7 digits of the Invoice #. Hover your mouse over the entry to
see the complete number.
• Customer‐‐ Sorts the invoices alphabetically by Customer Name. The customer’s full name appears in
this field with the format of “Last Name, First Name.” For business customers, the company name will
be included in parenthesis underneath the main contact’s full name.   Click once to sort from A‐to‐Z,
click again to sort from Z‐to‐A.
• Created‐‐ Sorts the invoices by the date they were created. Click once to sort past‐to‐future, click again
to sort future‐to‐past.
NOTE: The Created date is the date the invoice was entered into ADP Payments, NOT the date it was or
will be sent to your customer. For example, if I created a one‐time invoice on March 15 with an Invoice
date of April 1, the Created date would be March 15.
• Due‐‐ Sorts the invoices by due date. Click once to sort past‐to‐future, click again to sort future‐to‐past.
• Days Past Due‐‐ Sorts the invoices by the number of days Past Due they are. Invoices with a Status of
“Past Due” will contain a value in this field. This field will be blank for Paid invoices, and invoices that
have not yet reached their due date.   Click once to sort blank‐to‐high, click again to sort high‐to‐blank.
• Inv. amount‐‐ Sorts the invoices numerically by dollar amount. Click once to sort low‐to‐high, click
again to sort high‐to‐low.
• Balance‐‐ Sorts the invoices by the amount outstanding (the amount that still needs to be paid).   Click
once to sort low‐to‐high, click again to sort high‐to‐low.
You can also filter the one‐time invoices table by invoice status, date, and customer, as described in the following
sections. You can use any combination of filters to refine your list.   For example, this is how you can see all invoices
for Sam Pell created in the last 30 days, with a Status of “Paid”:
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 213
• Set Invoice Status Display filter to “Paid.”
• Set Date range filter to “30 Days.”
• Select “Sam Pell” as the customer using the Search field.
To clear filters and return to the full invoice list, click the “clear search” link.
Filter by Invoice Status
The invoice Status filter instructs the report to return only those invoices that match the selected statuses. The
following invoice status filters are available:
• All‐‐ All invoices, regardless of status. This is the default view for the screen. You can return to it by
selecting “All” or by clicking the “clear search” link.
• Past Due invoices‐‐ The invoice has not been paid, and the Due date has passed.
• Unpaid invoices‐‐ The invoice has not been paid, and the Due date has not yet passed.
• Paid invoices‐‐ The invoice has been paid in full.
• Paid (partial) invoices‐‐ The invoice has been partially paid, and has a balance remaining on it.
NOTE: You will only see this status if you have enabled your system to accept partial payments of
invoices.
• Cancelled‐‐ The invoice was sent to your customer but later cancelled and will not be paid.
• Draft invoices‐‐ The invoice has been saved, but not yet activated and sent to your customer.
The Status filter only takes the primary invoice status component into account, it does
not filter based on the secondary component that indicates whether the invoice has
been sent.
There is currently no way to filter based on the “(Sent)” or “(Unsent)” status
component.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 214
To create an invoice status filter, follow the steps below:
1. Click the down arrow for the Display drop‐down box, as shown below:
2. Check the boxes for the statuses you want to include in the table.
3. Click the “view selected invoices” link.
4. The drop‐down box will close, and the table will be filtered based on the statuses you selected and the
SNAPSHOT summary will change to reflect only those invoices included in the filtered table.
To clear all filters, click the “clear search” link.
Filter by Date Range
The Date range filter instructs the report to return only those invoices that were entered into ADP Payments (either
manually by you, or those automatically generated by a recurring invoice schedule) during the selected date range.
You can select one of the pre‐configured filters listed below, or enter your own custom date range for the filter.
• 12 months‐‐ Invoices entered over the past 360 days.
• Last 6 months‐‐ Invoices entered over the past 180 days.
• Last 90 days‐‐ Invoices entered over the past 90 days.
• Last 30 days‐‐ Invoices entered over the past 30 days. This is the default view when you open the
manage invoices screen.
• Last 15 days‐‐ Invoices entered over the past 15 days.
• Today‐‐ Invoices entered on the current calendar day.
• Yesterday‐‐ Invoices entered on the previous calendar day.
• All‐‐ All invoices in your system.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 215
To create a date range date filter, follow the steps below:

back arrowsin the calendar. Or, click the month, year heading at the top of the calendar
to change to a full year view.
Advance years by using the left and right arrows, then click on the month to open the
calendar page and select a specific day.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 216
Filter by Customer
The customer filter instructs the table report to return only those invoices that were entered into ADP Payments for
a specific customer. The filter will not permit you to display invoices from multiple customers. For example, by
typing “Smith” into the box, you cannot return invoices for all customers with a last name of “Smith.”
The customer filter is a context‐sensitive search. This means that you can enter any three character part of a
customer’s first name, last name, or company name in the Search field, and the search will return all matches for
that string. In the example shown below, the search string “Pell” returned matches for customers with a last name of
“Pell” as well as companies that have names containing “Pell.”   
Follow the steps below to create a customer filter:
1. Enter any three character part of a customer’s first name, last name, or company name in the Search field.
2. From the list of matches, click on the one you want to use as the filter.
3. The drop‐down box will close, the table will be filtered based on the customer you selected, and the
SNAPSHOT will be updated to cover only the filtered list.
To remove the customer filter along with all other filters, click the “clear search” link.
EXPORTING INVOICE HISTORY
You can export your invoice history as a .csv (comma delimited text) file that can be opened in Excel for advanced
reporting and charting, or can be imported into any other software system that accepts .csv imports.
The export file will contain all of the records included in the Invoices table. Thus, to export a subset of your invoices,
first filter the table. For example:
• To export all of your invoices select “All” as the date filter.
• To export all invoices for a single customer, use the Customer filter. (See Filter by Customer above.)
• To export all “Past Due” invoices, use the Status filter. (See Filter by Invoice Status above.)
• To export all invoices sent in the last week, use the Date filter. (See Filter by Date Range above.)
• To export all “Cancelled” invoices for the current month, use both the Status filter and the Date filter.
The following sections describe how to export the file and define each column in the export.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 217
How to Export Invoice History

EDITING AND DELETING DRAFT INVOICES
When you enter a new one‐time invoice and save it as a “Draft” (See Save the Invoice as a Draft above), you can go
back and edit or delete it later.    
The following sections describe how to edit and delete draft invoices.
Editing a Draft Invoice
1. Locate the invoice in the Invoices table, and select “Edit invoice” from the Action menu, as shown:
2. The saved draft of the invoice will open. You can make changes to any sections of the invoice. (See Entering
One‐time Invoices above for descriptions of all sections of an invoice.)
NOTE: Be sure that you update the Invoice date field to the current date if you want to send the invoice
immediately.
3. When you are done making changes, you can take one of the following actions, accessed via the bottom
buttons shown below:
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 221
  a. Send the Invoice:
  i. Click the “send invoice” button.
NOTE: If there are any errors in the invoice, the system will prompt you to correct them at this
point. Make any corrections, and click the “send invoice” button again.
  ii. The Select invoice send options window opens.
  iii. The top portion of the screen contains send configuration settings.
   1• The Send by field is used to select the method by which the invoice will be delivered to your customer.
You must select at least one of the boxes.
• The defaultsetting isto send the invoice via email. (E‐mail box checked.) Uncheck the box
if you do not want to email the invoice.
NOTE: Unchecking the box will hide all of the Email recipients settings fields as well as
the invoice email preview.
• To send the invoice via regular mail, check the Snail mail box. This will display your
customer’s mailing address for review.
NOTE: There is an additional charge for each mailed invoice, and you will need to
purchase snail mail creditsin order to use thisfeature. (See Snail Mail Credits in Chapter 8
for details.)
   2• The E‐mail recipients section is only visible when the E‐mail box is checked. Use this section to control to
whom the email is sent, and the items included in the email.
NOTE: If you only checked the Snail mail box, skip this section and go directly to step v.
• The email is always sent to your customer’s default email address, which is displayed.
• You can enter any email address in the Send to other field, or enter multiple email
addresses separated by commas. (200 characters maximum) Each time the invoice is
sent, it will also go to these addresses.
• Checking the Send me a copy box will CC the email to your company’s default email
address (shown in parenthesis).
NOTE: If you have this box checked by default for all invoices, you can configure the
system to do this. Go to the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐>Email preferences and
templates screen, and in the INVOICES section select the “Yes, cc me on all invoices”
radio button. You can also change the address to which this email is sent from that
screen. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8.)
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 222
• Checking the Attach invoice as a PDF file box will instruct the system to attach a .pdf
version of the invoice to the email sent to your customer. This will enable the customer to
view and save the invoice directly from the email, even if they are not connected to the
Internet.
NOTE: The “click here” link and the “pay invoice now” button in the invoice email opens
your Customer Portal log‐in screen. Your customers can log‐into Customer Portal to view
the invoice and make a payment (or download a .pdf version of the invoice). They can
also view the invoice online and pay it as a guest (or download the .pdf as a guest) if you
have configured your system to accept guest payments. (See Invoice Settings in Chapter 8
for how to configure this setting.)
• You can attach any file to the invoice as long as it is under 2MB. (Potentially dangerous
file types such as .exe files will be rejected.) Click the Browse button next to the Add
attachment field, then select the file you want to attach from your computer. The file
path will be displayed in the field. (Click the “Delete” link to clear the Add attachment
field and remove the file from the invoice.)
NOTE: The file will only be attached the first time the invoice is sent‐‐ it is not saved by
the system and will not be automatically resent if the invoice is resent (either manually or
via the overdue invoice reminder function.) However, you can attach the file again each
time you email the invoice to your customer.
  iv. The bottom portion of the screen contains a preview of the invoice Subject and Message, and is
view only. Changes can’t be made from this screen. It displays the text message that will be sent
with the invoice. The email is always sent to your customer’s default email address, which is
displayed.

invoice underneath this message and a “Pay Invoice Now” button that your customer can click to
log‐into your Customer Portal and pay the invoice online. There will also be a logo at the bottom of
the invoice identifying ADP Payments as the secure invoicing provider.
   
NOTE: If you would like to change the subject and/or text portion of the new invoice email
template (the condensed version of the invoice is not editable), it can be done from the
Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email preferences and templates screen. Scroll down to the
INVOICES section, and click the “Edit” link for the “New invoice email” template. (See Email
Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for detailed instructions.)

2. A pop‐up window will appear asking you to confirm the delete. Click “Yes” to delete the invoice.   
3. Click “OK” in the “Invoice Deleted” confirmation window to return to the table.
4. The invoice will be immediately deleted and will no longer appear in the table.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 228
EDITING UNPAID INVOICES
You can edit any invoice that has not been paid. This includes invoices with a status of “Unpaid” and invoices with a
status of “Past Due.”   It does not include invoices that have been partially paid (status = “Paid (partial)” or status =
“Past Due” where invoice Amount is greater than invoice Balance.)
NOTE: You can edit an individual invoice generated by an invoice schedule if it is unpaid. Any changes you make to
the individual invoice will not affect the schedule or any subsequent invoices generated by it.
When an invoice can be edited, you will see the “Edit invoice” link in the Action menu. The link will not be visible
when the function is unavailable.
Follow the steps below to edit an unpaid invoice:
1. Locate the invoice in the Invoices table, and click the Action button, then click the “Edit invoice” link.
2. The invoice will open in edit mode. You can make changes to any sections of the invoice except the Invoice
date and Invoice number. (See Entering One‐time Invoices above for descriptions of all invoice sections.)
NOTE: You can change the invoice Due Date to any date‐‐ either past or future.
3. When you are done making changes click the “save and re‐send” button to save your changes and send the

mail option to mail the invoice to your customer, and you do not want to pay to mail it again, uncheck the
Snail mail box and the changed invoice will be emailed to your customer at no cost.
If you click the “cancel” button on the Select Invoice Send Options screen you are returned to the edit
invoice screen and your changes are not saved.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 229
6. The system will then display the manage invoices screen, with a success message at the top, and the
invoice you just edited at the top of the table.
The invoice email (or snail mail invoice) re‐sent to your customer, as well as all other invoice views, will include a
Revised Invoice Date field. This field indicates to your customer that changes have been made to the invoice. If you
make multiple changes to an invoice, the Revised Invoice Date field will display the date of the most recent change.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 230
RESENDING INVOICES
Any invoice that has not been cancelled can be sent to your customer again. You can program ADP Payments to
automatically resend Past Due invoices via email (See Invoice Settings in Chapter 8), or you can manually resend any
unpaid or Past Due invoice via email or Snail mail (additional cost).
NOTE: Even if you have programmed ADP Payments to automatically resend invoices, you can still manually resend
any invoice that has not yet been paid.
To resend an invoice:
1. Locate the invoice you want to resend in the Invoices table.
2. Click the Action button, then click the “Resend invoice” link, as shown below:
3. The Select invoice send options window opens.    
4. Review the email settings, and make any changes or additions. Click the “send invoice” button to resend
the invoice via email and/or postal mail.
• The system always re‐sends an invoice to the customer’s current email or billing address‐‐ not
necessarily to the address used to send the original invoice. This way you or your customer
can update an email or postal address once and be confident that all invoices will go to the
correct address. The email/postal address displayed on this screen is the current address for
the customer.
• If you attached a file to the original invoice it will not be attached when you use the resend
function. If you want to send the attachment to your customer again, you will need to upload
the file again prior to clicking the “email invoice” button.Even if you didn’t use the Snail mail
option when you sent the original invoice, you can select it when resending the invoice so
that a copy of the most recent version (including partial payments made and any changes you
entered) is sent to your customer via regular mail. ( See above for instructions on sending
invoices via snail mail.)
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 231
When you resend invoices they will reflect the current status of the invoice, as well as any
payments made on it. For example, in the screen capture below the invoice has a status of
“Paid (partial)” and the $45 payment as well as the $45 balance are displayed.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 232
CANCELLING UNPAID INVOICES
Any invoice that has not yet been paid can be manually cancelled. Cancelling an invoice does not delete it from ADP
Payments. It simply tells the system that the invoice will not be paid and thus should not be included in “Past Due”
or “Outstanding” calculations.
To cancel an invoice that has not been paid:
1. Locate the invoice you want to cancel in the Invoices table. (The invoice must have a status of “Unpaid,” or
“Past Due.”)
2. Click the Action button then click the “Cancel invoice” link.
3. The invoice will be cancelled. It will appear at the top of the Invoices table, with a status of “Cancelled
(Sent).”
NOTE: Once you click the “Cancel invoice” link you will not be able to change your mind.
You can cancel an individual invoice that was generated by an Invoice Schedule without
affecting the schedule‐‐ the next invoice will be generated and sent on time even if the
previous invoice is “cancelled.”
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 233
DELETING UNPAID INVOICES
Any invoice that has not yet been paid or that has been cancelled can be manually deleted.   Once an invoice is
deleted it will no longer appear in any invoice tables or reports.
To delete an invoice that has not been paid:
1. Locate the invoice you want to delete in the Invoices table. (The invoice must have a status of “Unpaid,” or
“Past Due” or “Cancelled.”)
2. Click the Action button then click the “Delete invoice” link.
3. A pop‐up window will appear asking you to confirm the delete. Click “yes” to delete the invoice.
4. Another pop‐up window will appear confirming that the invoice has been deleted. Click “ok” to return to
the Invoices table.
5. The invoice will no longer appear in the table, nor will it appear in any other ADP Payments table or report.
NOTE: You will not be able to retrieve or view an invoice once it has been deleted. If you may need access to
the invoice in the future, cancel it instead of deleting it.
You can delete an individual invoice that was generated by an Invoice Schedule without
affecting the schedule‐‐ the next invoice will be generated and sent on time even if the
previous invoice is deleted.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 234
MARKING INVOICES AS PAID
If you receive a payment for an invoice outside of ADP Payments, you can record it in the system. For example, your
customers may mail you a check or money order or pay cash.
Detailed step‐by‐ step instructions on how to mark an invoice as “paid” in ADP Payments are provided below.
1. Locate the invoice you want to mark as paid in the Invoices table. (The invoice must have a status of “Paid
(Partial),” “Unpaid,” or “Past Due.”), as shown below:
2. Click the Action button then click the “Mark as paid” link.
3. A pop‐up box will appear asking you to enter the amount of the payment, as shown below:
• Leave the first radio box selected to mark the invoice as paid in full. If you do this, the invoice will have
a status of “Paid” after you click the “submit” button.
• Select the second radio button, and enter the amount of a partial payment. You can enter any amount
less than the “Full amount” of the invoice. (If you enter more than the Full amount, you will see an
error message and will need to restart the “Mark as paid” process at Step 1.)
NOTE: You will only have the partial payment option if you have enabled your system to accept partial
payments of invoices. If you don’t accept partial payments, you will not need to make a radio button
selection.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 235
4. Enter a Payment Note (optional).
NOTE: This note will be recorded in the Invoice History table on the View Invoice screen, as shown below.

• If you marked only a partial payment, you will see the pop‐up confirmation window shown below:
Select the appropriate button:
• keep it partially paid: Clicking this button records the partial payment and updates the transaction
status to “Paid (partial).” An updated invoice is not emailed to your customer.
• resend this invoice: Clicking this button records the partial payment and updates the transaction
status to “Paid (partial).” It also opens the Send invoice by email screen where you can review
email settings and resend the invoice to your customer with the partial payment confirmed.

6. You will be returned to the Invoices table, a success message will appear above the table, and the invoice
will be at the top of the table with a new status of “Paid” or “Paid (partial).”
NOTE: If you mark an invoice as paid by mistake, or if the payment you receive is later returned (like a bounced
check) you can mark the invoice as unpaid. See Marking Invoices as Unpaid in the following section.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 236
MARKING INVOICES AS UNPAID
If you mistakenly mark an invoice as paid, or if the payment for an invoice is later returned or rejected, you can
manually mark the invoice as unpaid. For example, your customer’s check may bounce weeks after you initially
received it.
The option to mark an invoice as unpaid is available to all paid and partially paid invoices‐‐ those you manually
marked as paid, those for which you collected a payment using the system, and those your customers paid online.
Follow the steps below to mark an invoice as unpaid.
1. Locate the invoice you want to mark as unpaid in the Invoices table. (The invoice must have a status of
“Paid” or “Paid (Partial).”   
2. Click the Action button then click the “Mark as unpaid” link.
3. You will be returned to the Invoices table, a success message will appear above the table, and the invoice
will be at the top of the table with a new status of “Unpaid.”   
When you view the invoice (by clicking the linked Inv. # in the Invoices table), and scroll to the Invoice History
section, you’ll see the change from paid to unpaid documented, as shown below:
NOTE: If you mark an invoice as unpaid by mistake you can always mark it as paid again. (See Marking Invoices as
Paid for instructions.)
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 237
PROCESSING PAYMENTS FOR SPECIFIC INVOICES
You can easily process payments over the phone or in person for ADP Payments invoices. Detailed step‐by‐ step
instructions are provided below.
1. Locate the invoice for which you want to collect payment in the Invoices table.
• The easiest way to do this is to filter the table by Customer. (See Filter by Customer above for
instructions.)
2. Click the Action button then click the “Collect payment” link, as shown below:
3. A collect new payment screen opens, with the customer loaded, the Invoice number field populated with
the appropriate invoice number, and the Payment amount field populated with the total balance due for
the invoice, as shown below:
4. If your customer is making a partial payment, you can lower the Payment amount to the amount of the
installment being paid. Otherwise, leave this field as is.
NOTE: You will not be able to edit this field if you do not have partial invoice payments enabled for your
ADP Payments system.
5. The Payment type field will be filled with “One‐time payment” and you will not be able to edit this value.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 238
6. The Payment date field defaults to the current date. Leave this as is to process the payment immediately.
NOTE: You can select a future date for the payment. See Scheduling One‐Time Payments for a Future Date
in Chapter 4 for details on how one‐time payments for a future date are processed by the system.
7. In the Choose A Payment Method section, select Echeck (ACH) or Credit Card, and then select the account
to use or enter a new one. (See Entering One‐time Payments in Chapter 4 for instructions.)
NOTE: The default account for the Payment Method will be automatically selected.
8. Make any modifications necessary to Email receipt and failure notifications. (See Entering One‐time
Payments in Chapter 4 for how to do this.)
9. Click the “collect payment” button. (If there are any errors, you will be prompted to correct them at this
point. After making required changes, click the “collect payment” button again.)
10. You are sent to the manage payments screen, with the payment you just processed at the top of the table.
11. When you return to the manage invoices screen, by clicking the invoices button in side navigation, the
invoice will appear in the table with a status of “Paid” or “Paid (partial)” as shown below:
12. If you click the linked Inv. # to view the invoice, the Transaction ID for the payment will be noted in Invoice
History. Click the linked Transaction ID to view Transaction Details.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 239
VIEWING INVOICE PAYMENTS
When invoice payments are made, online by your customers or entered by you or your staff using the “collect a
payment now” link, you can view those payments in the manage payments screen. (See Processing Payments for
Specific Invoices above.)
The invoice number for each payment is shown in the Invoice # column, as shown below:
NOTE: Payments can be entered without an invoice number. Any payment made to discharge a ADP Payments
invoice will always record the invoice number, which will be displayed in the Invoice # column in the Invoices table.
PROCESSING INVOICE PAYMENTS DIRECTLY FROM THE COLLECT NEW PAYMENT SCREEN
ONE‐TIME PAYMENTS
By loading a customer in the collect new paymentscreen, and entering a ADP Payments
system invoice number attached to that customer in the Invoice number field, you can
attach the payment to the invoice. (See Entering One‐time Payments in Chapter 4 for
instructions.) However, because this method has limitations (see this note), you should
use the method described above for processing one‐time invoice payments.
RECURRING PAYMENTS
You can create a payment plan schedule to discharge an invoice. To do this, follow the
steps for creating a payment plan schedule (See Entering Recurring Payment Plan
Schedules in Chapter 4 for instructions), using the following settings:
• Load the customer to which the invoice is attached.
• Enter the exact invoice number that appears in the Invoices table in the Invoice
number field. For example, if the invoice table displays “00099” you must enter
“00099” as entering “99” will not attach the payment to the invoice.
• Enter the invoice Total Due in the schedule Total Due field.
• Configure the rest of the schedule as desired for number of payments,
frequency and start date.
• You can enter a Custom First payment (optional), and it too will be used to
discharge the invoice.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 240
COPYING INVOICES
To help make invoice entry easier, ADP Payments provides the ability to copy the Goods and Services, Payment
Terms, Discount and Note for customer from an existing invoice into a new invoice. This should help you eliminate
duplicate data entry if you often send the same or similar invoices to different customers.
To copy an invoice:
1. Go to the manage invoices tab, and locate the invoice you want to duplicate.
2. Click the Action button, then click the “Copy invoice” link as shown below:
3. The send new invoice screen opens with the Goods and Services, Payment Terms, Discount and Note for
customer sections auto‐filled with values from the invoice you selected.
4. In the Customer field, search for and load the customer to whom you want to send the new invoice or
enter a new customer. (See Loading and Entering Customers for New Invoices and Schedules above for how
to do this.)
NOTE: You can load the same customer to whom the original invoice was sent, or a different customer.
5. Customize this invoice by making changes to any of the fields, Line Items, Payment Terms, Discount or
Notes. (See Entering One‐time Invoices above.)
6. Click the “send invoice” button to save and email the invoice.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 241
PRINTING INVOICES
You can print any invoice you enter in ADP Payments except for one that has been cancelled (status= “cancelled”).
Printed invoices can be used for record keeping, or if you want to mail a paper invoice yourself (instead of using the
Snail mail service) to your customer instead of emailing the invoice.

they can access your Customer Portal.
Many people have Internet access and can make online payments even if they do not
have, or are unwilling to supply you with, an email address.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 242
VIEWING INVOICES
You can view any one‐time invoice or any invoice generated by a recurring invoice schedule regardless of status.
Viewing an invoice displays it exactly as it will appear to your customer when they view it online. At the bottom of
the invoice view screen you will see a table listing each time the invoice was emailed to your customer and an
Invoice History table listing all system actions associated with the invoice.
The top of the invoice view screen provides access to all of the Actions available for that invoice. It provides the
same options you will find in the Action menu.
You will also be able to enter comments related to the invoice from this screen. When you’re done viewing the
invoice, click the back button to return to the previous page, or select another navigational option.
To view an invoice:

  b. The links at the top of the invoice vary depending on invoice status. They launch the same functions as
the links of the same name in the Action menu in the Invoices table on the manage invoices screen.
When you view invoicesthey will reflect the currentstatus of the invoice, as well as any
payments made on it. For example, in the screen capture below the invoice has a status
of “Paid (partial)” and a $45 payment as well as a $45 balance are displayed.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Invoices 244
  c. The Email history table at the bottom of the screen contains a row for each time the invoice was sent,
and provides send date, the email to which it was sent, the subject line of the email, and the file names
for any attachments sent with the invoice email.
NOTE: If you check the “Attach invoice as PDF” box, the Attachments column will include a file named
“Invoice.pdf.” The file name will be the same for every invoice, regardless of invoice number.   
  i. The emails are displayed 10 at a time from oldest to newest. If there are more than 10 emails, you
can use the page number links at the bottom of the table to page through them.
  ii. You can change the Display drop‐down to show 10, 25, 50, or 100 emails at once.
  iii. Use the Search field to search for a particular email.
  d. The Invoice History table includes a row for each change made to the invoice (for example a partial
payment was received, or the invoice amount was changed).
When an invoice has been paid via ADP Payments (whether you enter the payment for
the customer or whether the customer pays online), the Transaction ID for the
payment will be included in Invoice History. Click the linked Transaction ID to open its
Transaction Details screen.

Managing Recurring Invoices
The manage recurring invoices tab in the Invoices center, shown below, provides access to all invoice schedules
entered in your ADP Payments system.   
From the manage recurring invoices screen you can suspend and re‐activate schedules, edit draft schedules, view
and print schedule details as well as a list of invoices generated by each schedule, and export schedule details. You

Filter by Customer
The customer filter instructs the report to return only those schedules that were entered into ADP Payments for a
specific customer. The filter will not permit you to display schedules from multiple customers. For example, by
typing “Smith” into the box, you cannot return schedules for all customers with a last name of “Smith.”
The customer filter is a context‐sensitive search. This means that you can enter any three character part of a
customer’s first name, last name, or company name in the Search field, and the search will return all matches for
that string. In the example shown below, the search string “pell” returned matches for a customers with a last name
of “Pell” as well as companies that have names containing “pell.”   
Follow the steps below to create a customer filter:
1. Enter any three character part of a customer’s first name, last name, or company name in the Search field.
2. From the list of matches, click on the one you want to use as the filter.

EXPORTING RECURRING INVOICE SCHEDULES
You can export your recurring invoice schedules as a .csv (comma delimited text) file that can be opened in Excel for
advanced reporting and charting, or can be imported into any other software system that accepts .csv imports.
The export file will contain all of the records included in the Recurring Invoices table. Thus, to export a subset of
your invoices, first filter the table. For example:
• To export all of your schedules select “All” as the date filter.
• To export all invoice schedules for a single customer, use the Customer filter. (See Filter by Customer
above.)
• To export all “Active” invoice schedules, use the Status filter. (See Filter by Schedule Status above.)
• To export all schedules with activity in the last week, use the Date filter. (See Filter by Date Range
above.)

SUSPENDING/RESUMING INVOICE SCHEDULES
You cannot delete a recurring invoice schedule from ADP Payments once it has begun (the Start date has passed and
the first invoice from the schedule has been generated). However, you can suspend it so that it no longer generates
new invoices. To suspend a recurring invoice schedule:
1. Locate the schedule you want to Suspend in the Recurring Invoices table.
2. In the Action menu, click the “Suspend” link, as shown below.
NOTE: You will only see this option if the schedule is “Active”
3. You will now see the Status of the schedule changed to “Suspended” and the Next Invoice Date is blank, as
shown below.
Once a recurring invoice schedule has been “Suspended” you can turn it back on at any time. To do this:
1. Locate the schedule you want to Resume in the Recurring Invoices table.
2. In the Action menu, click the “Resume recurring schedule” link, as shown below.
NOTE: You will only see this option if the schedule Status is “Suspended.”
3. You will now see the Status of the schedule changed to “Active” and the Next Invoice Date will display the
next date the schedule will generate an invoice.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Recurring Invoices 264
DELETING INVOICE SCHEDULES
You can only delete a recurring invoice schedule that has not yet started and has not yet generated an invoice. Thus
you can delete all “Draft” invoice schedules. You can also delete any invoice schedule for which the Last Sent field is
blank.
To delete a Draft recurring invoice schedule
1. Locate the schedule you want to Delete in the Recurring Invoices table.
2. Click the “Delete” link in the Action menu.
3. A pop‐up window will appear asking you to confirm the delete. Click “yes” to delete the invoice schedule.
4. Another pop‐up window will appear confirming that the invoice schedule has been deleted. Click “ok” to
return to the Recurring Invoices table.   
5. The invoice will no longer appear in the table, nor will it appear in any other ADP Payments table or report.
NOTE: You will not be able to retrieve or view an invoice schedule once it has been deleted.
To delete a recurring invoice schedule that has not yet started
There are two steps to deleting a recurring invoice schedule that has not yet started, first suspend the schedule then
delete it.
1. Locate the schedule you want to Delete in the Recurring Invoices table.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Recurring Invoices 265
2. Click the “Suspend” link in the Action menu.
3. The Status of the schedule will change to “Suspended” as shown below.
4. From the Action menu, click the “Delete” link.
NOTE: You will only see this link on schedules with a status of “Suspended” if the Last Sent date is blank.
5. A pop‐up window will appear asking you to confirm the delete. Click “yes” to delete the invoice schedule.
6. Another pop‐up window will appear confirming that the invoice schedule has been deleted. Click “ok” to
return to the Recurring Invoices table.
7. The invoice will no longer appear in the table, nor will it appear in any other ADP Payments table or report.
NOTE: You will not be able to retrieve or view an invoice schedule once it has been deleted. If you may need
access to the schedule in the future, suspend it instead of deleting it.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Recurring Invoices 266
COPYING INVOICE SCHEDULES
To help make invoice schedule entry easier, ADP Payments provides the ability to copy the invoice Frequency, Start
and End dates, Goods and Services, Payment Terms, Discount and Note for customer from an existing invoice
schedule into a new invoice schedule. This should help you eliminate duplicate data entry if you often send the same
or similar invoices to different customers.
To copy an invoice schedule:
1. Go to the manage recurring invoices tab, and in the table locate the invoice schedule you want to
duplicate.
2. From the Action menu, select the “Copy” link as shown below:
3. The send new invoice screen opens with the Frequency, Start and End dates, Goods and Services,
Payment Terms, Discount and Note for customersections auto‐filled with values from the invoice schedule
you selected.
4. In the Customer field, search for and load the customer who will receive the new invoices. (See Loading
and Entering Customers for New Invoices and Schedules above for instructions on how to do this.)
NOTE: You can load the same customer to whom the original schedule was sent, or a different customer.
5. Customize this invoice by making changes to any of the fields, the schedule, Line Items, Payment terms or
notes. (See Entering Recurring Invoice Schedules above.)
6. Save a draft, Preview or Activate the invoice schedule. Or click the “cancel” button to discard it.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Managing Recurring Invoices 267
PRINTING INVOICE SCHEDULES
You can print a sample invoice from any recurring invoice schedule. The printout will give you an idea of what the
actual invoice will look like. However, the Invoice number and Due date will not be accurately reflected, as both of
these are generated by ADP Payments when individual scheduled invoices are sent.
To print a sample invoice for an invoice schedule:
1. Locate the invoice schedule for which you want to print a sample in the Recurring Invoices table.
2. Click the Action button then click the “Print invoice information” link.
3. A new browser window will open with a preview of a sample invoice on screen, and the system will call up
your default printer.
4. Change printers if desired, and click the “Print” button to print the invoice or the “cancel” button if you
decide not to print.
5. Close the print window when you’re done printing the invoice.
If you want to give your customer a printed copy of an invoice generated by a schedule,
you should use the print function for the individual invoice NOT the print function for
the schedule.
To do this, click the “View scheduled invoices” link in the Action menu for the schedule
in question. Locate the individual invoice you want to print in the table, then click the
“Print invoice” link in the Action menu. (See Viewing Individual Invoices Generated by
Invoice Schedules for detailed instructions.)
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 268
Invoice Line Items
As part of creating invoices in ADP Payments you enter Line Items in the Goods and Services section of the invoice.
There are three components to a Line Item: the List item, the quantity, and up to two taxes.
You can enter Line Items individually when you create an invoice or invoice schedule, or you can retrieve a saved list
of Line Items‐‐ which is particularly useful if you often send similar invoices to multiple customers. In addition to
manually entering items, you can import your Items List into ADP Payments.
The following sections walk you through each of these tasks.
ADDING NEW ITEMS
New items can be added to your ADP Payments system individually from the send new invoices screen in the
Invoices center, or from the items screen accessed the Configuration tab in the Settings center. You can also import
a batch of items from the import center.
You can enter an item while creating a new invoice or invoice schedule, or you can pre‐enter a catalog of items and
then use them in your invoices. Either way, any time you enter a new item it will be added to your stored items
catalog for use in future invoices. You can edit and delete items in the stored items catalog from the “manage list
items” link in the Goods and Services header bar (See Managing Items below), or from the items screen in the
Settings center (See Items section in Chapter 8).
The following sections walk you through adding items individually and importing a List Item batch.
Adding Items Individually
You can enter new items while creating invoices from the send new invoice screen, or from the items management
screen accessed from the Configuration tab in the Settings center. This section provides instructions for entering
items while creating an invoice. For instructions on how to enter and manage items from the items management
screen, see Items in Chapter 8.
To enter a new Item from the Invoices center, follow the steps below:
1. Go to the send new invoice tab in the Invoices center.
2. In the Goods and Services section, click the down arrow on the
Select Item drop‐down box.
3. At the bottom of the list of items (if any), select “Add new
item.”
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 269
4. The Create a new good or service pop‐up screen appears.
5. Enter an Item name, a brief Description, and a unit Price for the item.
NOTE: Everything you enter will be displayed to your customers on invoices. Additionally, the Item name
will be displayed in the “Select item” drop‐down box.
NOTE: You can create items with a positive or negative price. For example, to create an item that costs $10,
enter “10.” To create an item that credits $10, enter “‐10.”
6. Click the “save and select” button to save the new item and use it for a Line Item in the active invoice. Or,
click the “cancel” button to discard it.
NOTE: To complete the Line Item for use in an actual invoice, you need to change the quantity in the Qty
field as required, and add Tax 1 and/or Tax 2 as applicable. (See Entering One‐time Invoices above.)
7. Repeat steps 2‐6 to add additional items to your saved items catalog.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 270
Importing Item Batches
The List Item import is designed to enable you to import a product or service catalog for use with creating ADP
Paymentsinvoices. When items are successfully imported, they will be available from the Item drop‐down list on the
send new invoice screen, and can be edited or deleted from the list item management screen accessed from the
“items” link in the Settings‐‐> Configuration tab or from the “manage list items” link in the Goods and Services
header bar.
Detailed field requirements for list item imports, as well as all ADP Payments imports, can be found in Appendix C:
Import Requirements.
This section covers how to import list item batches. For more information on the ADP Payments Import Center, and
batch status and error reporting, see Import Center in Chapter 8.
The following are the basic steps to take when importing a list item batch:
1. Create your Item import file.
2. Upload the file into ADP Payments on the Settings‐‐> Import Center screen.
3. Map fields from your file to ADP Payments system fields.
4. Review your field mapping.
5. Submit the List Item import file for processing.
6. View the results of the import.
The following sections walk you through all of these steps.
Once saved, you can edit items from the “manage list items” link in the Goods and
Services header bar (See Managing Items below.) or from the items management
screen (See Items in Chapter 8).
If you attempt to use an existing item name while entering a new item, you will see an
error prompting you to use a new name.   The system will not overwrite the existing
item.
You can change the price and the description of an item on individual invoices, but
those changes will only be used for that invoice‐‐ They will not be attached to the
stored item. The next time you select the item from the drop‐down box, the original
values will be loaded into the invoice.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 271
Creating a List Item Import File
ADP Payments import files must be in .csv (comma delimited text) format or pipe delimited text format. You can use
column headers in your file if you like. (You can also upload files without headers.) You do not need to use the ADP
Payments field names in your header row. Use field names you will easily recognize since you will be mapping these
fields to ADP Payments system fields during the import process.
For more information on proper formatting of ADP Payments import files, see Appendix C: Import Requirements.
(For details specific to List Item imports, see List Item Import Requirements in Appendix )
When creating your List Item import file, you must include each of the three fields that comprise an item.
• Item Name: The name of the product or service.
NOTE: There is a 300 character restriction on this field. But, this is the text that will appear in the Item
drop‐down box, so you may want to keep it short.
• Item Description: A description of the product or service. (Maximum 500 characters.)
• Price: The unit price for the item. (Two decimal places only, i.e. 1.23 NOT 1.235)
NOTE: Do not include the “$” in this field.
A sample List Item import file created in Excel is shown below:
The easiest way to create and save your List Item import file is to create it in Excel then export it as a .csv file. To do
this, use the “save as” function in Excel, and select “comma delimited csv” as the file type.
Uploading a List Item Import File
Once you have created your List Item import file, follow these steps to import it into ADP Payments.
1. Go to the ADP Payments Import Center by clicking the “Import” link at the top of the List Item
Management screen,
Do not use commas or hard returns in any of the fields when creating a .csv import file.
Doing so will corrupt your data and cause values to be mapped to the wrong fields. For
example, you should never enter an item name as “Large Widget, Pink” Instead, enter
“Large Widget: Pink” or “Large Pink Widget”
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 272
2. The Import Center dashboard screen opens, as shown below. (For more information on the Import Center
dashboard see Import Center Dashboard in Chapter 8.)
3. In the Import type field drop‐down box, select “Items.”
4. Enter a short descriptive name for your import in the Import name field. This name will be used when
referencing this particular import batch in tables on the Import Center dashboard.
5. Enter a short description of the upload in the Import description field. (Optional)
6. In the File type drop‐down box select the type of file you will be importing. You can use a .csv file
(recommended) or a pipe‐delimited text file.
7. If the file you are importing contains a header row, check the First row is header checkbox. (Using a header
row is very helpful for the field mapping that you will perform in Step 11.)   If there is no header row, leave
this box unchecked.
8. Click the “Choose File” button to locate the import batch file on your computer.
9. Click the “upload” button to begin the import process.
10. The system will perform a preliminary validation of your file. If it is corrupt or unusable, you will see an
error message. Otherwise, you will see the Map Field Titles screen, shown below:   
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 273
• The first column displays the values in the first row of each column in your file. These will either be the
values in your header row, or the first row of data (if your file does not contain a header row).
• The second column contains drop‐down boxes used to map fields in your file to ADP Payments system
fields.
• The Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box enables you to select a saved mapping schema. (See
About Saved Mapping Schemes in Chapter 8 for instructions on using saved mappings.)
• The “reset mapping” button will clear all values in the System Field Names drop‐down boxes so that
you can begin the mapping process again.
• The help box, located under the “reset mapping” button provides definitions for all of the ADP
Payments List Item system fields. Select a field name from the drop‐down, and its definition will
appear under the box.
11. For each column you want to map from your file, select a corresponding ADP Payments field from the
associated drop‐down box, as shown below. If you do not want to map a field from your file, leave the
corresponding drop‐down box set to “‐Select Column‐.”
NOTE: Fields that you select will disappear from the list of available fields. This prevents you from
accidentally creating duplicate mappings.   
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 274
12. Once you finish mapping fields it should look something like the sample below. Click the “continue” button.
13. On the next screen (shown below), enter a name for the mapping you just created in the Mapping Name
field. You can select this mapping at a later date from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box to quickly
map a file using the same column structure.
NOTE: You are required to save your mapping. Even if you never expect to use it again, storing it will save
time if there is an error processing your import file and you need to upload your file again.
14. Enter a Description for the mapping if you like. (Optional)
15. Click the “save & continue” button.
16. The Approve File Import For Processing screen appears, as shown below.   
• The top line (in white) contains the ADP Payments system field names, in alphabetical order.
• The second line (in purple) appears only if your file has a header row, and contains the field names in
that header row.
• The following 5 lines (in white) contain the first 5 data rows from your file. You can scroll through them
in the table.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 275
17. Double check that your mapping correctly matched fields in your file to ADP Payments system fields.
  a. If you see an error, click the “back to mapping” button to return to the mapping screen (Step 11.),
correct any errors, and proceed.
  b. When you’re satisfied with the mapping, click the “approve batch” button.
18. When the file is successfully uploaded and queued for processing, you’ll see an on‐screen success message
as shown below. (If there are errors you’ll see an on‐screen message indicating the required corrections.)
19. Click the “Import Center” link to return to the Import Center dashboard and view the status of your file.
20. Continue with Viewing Results from a List Item Import.
Viewing Results from a List Item Import
After you successfully import your file, you will see your file in one of the Import Center tables. (See Import Center
Dashboard in Chapter 8 for details on this screen.)
• Imports Queued for Processing: If your file is in this table, it is waiting to be processed. Check back
later for a final status.
• Imports Needing Attention: All or part of the file has not been processed. Click the “View Errors” link
to view problems. (See Troubleshooting Import Batch Errors in Chapter 8 for how to troubleshoot
“Needs Attention” batches.)
• Processing Imports: Your file is currently being processed by the system.
• Completed Imports: (shown below): Your file has been processed by the system, all rows were
successfully imported, all customers were added, and all payments were successfully processed.
If your import was successful, you should see all of the items you added in the Select item drop‐down list on the
send new invoice screen, and in the List Item Management screen.
If there were errors, the file will be listed in the Imports Needing Attention section of the Import Center dashboard,
and you will need to correct the problems and re‐import any unprocessed rows. See Troubleshooting Import Batch
Errors in Chapter 8 for details.)
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 276
MANAGING ITEMS
Once you have added items to ADP Payments (see Adding New Items above), you can edit them and delete them
from the List Item Management screen. Access this screen from the “manage list items” link on the Goods and
Services navigation bar, as shown below, or from the items screen accessed from the Configuration tab in the
Settings section.
This section will provide instructions for using the List Item Management screen from the “manage list items” link
on the send new invoice screen. For instructions on using the items management screen in the Settings center, see
Items in Chapter 8.   
The List Item Management screen displays your items 10 at a time. Use the page number links at the bottom of the
table to page through your results. The table contains the item Name, the Description, and the unit Price. Click the
linked column headers to sort by that column. (Click once to sort low‐to‐high, click again to sort high‐to‐low.) The
default sort is to list the oldest item first.
When you click the “manage list items” link, the List Item Management screen opens,
and you will lose any data you have entered on the send new invoice screen. To avoid
losing data, be certain to use this link only from a blank invoice.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 277
Items can be edited and deleted via links in the Action menu.
To edit an item
1. Locate the item you want to edit in the table, and click the “edit” link in the Action menu.
2. The Edit good or service screen opens with the current values for the item.
3. Make changes to the Item name, Description and/or Price as required.
4. Click the “save” button to save the change (or click the “cancel” button to discard it).
5. You are returned to the Manage List Items screen, and the changes you made are reflected in the table.
To delete an item
1. Locate the item you want to delete the table, and click the “delete” link in the Action menu.
2. A pop‐up window appears asking you to confirm the delete. Click “yes” to delete, or click “no” to leave the
item as is.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 278
3. Another pop‐up window appears confirming that the item has been deleted. Click “ok” to close it and
return to the List Item Management screen.
Other actions accessible from the Manage List Items Screen
Add, Import, and Export items functions are accessed from the text links at the top of the List Item Management
screen. These functions are described in detail in the sections listed below.
• Adding Items Individually
• Importing Item Batches
• Exporting Items
Editing or deleting a List Item will not affect any previously created one‐time invoices
or invoice schedules. One‐time invoices will always reflect the item names,
descriptions, and prices used when they were created. Recurring invoices generated as
part of invoice schedules will always be created using the item names, descriptions,
and prices used when they were created.
If you have raised prices or changed the descriptions of items, and you want those
reflected on upcoming scheduled invoices, you need to edit the original schedule.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 279
EXPORTING ITEMS
Once you have added items to ADP Payments (see Adding New Items above), you can export them as a .csv file for
use with inventory or other types of external software. The export function is accessed from the List Item
Management screen reached by clicking the “manage list items” link on the Goods and Services navigation bar, as
shown below, or by clicking the “items” link on the Configuration tab in the Settings section.
To export your entire List Item catalog click the “export” link at the top of the item table.    
You will be prompted to either save or open the .csv file. In most cases (unless you have your system default csv files
to a different program), the file will open in Excel, but will not be saved. You will need to save the file if you want to
store it on your computer.
A sample export, viewed in Excel, is shown below:
The file will always contain your complete catalog of items‐‐ it is not possible to filter the export. The following four
fields are included:
• Id: The ADP Payments system ID assigned to the List Item. You will never see this ID in the application
itself.
• Name: The text you entered in the item “Name” field for the item.
• Description: The text you entered in the item “Description” field for the item.
• Price: The unit price of the item as you entered it. Values here can be positive or negative.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 280
SAVING AND RETRIEVING LISTS OF ITEMS
Lists of Items are a handy way to quickly populate the Goods and Services section of an invoice with a pre‐defined
set of Line Items. Lists of Items are accessed from the “saved lists of items” link in the Goods and Services header
bar.
For each Line Item in a List of Items the system stores the Item, the Description, the quantity (Qty), the unit Price,
Tax 1 and Tax 2, and the Amount. When you select the List of Items, all Line Items within it are loaded into the
Goods and Services section of the invoice. At that point you can complete the invoice and send it. Or you can add,
edit or delete Line Items before sending.
Saving Lists of Items
Follow the steps below to save a List of Items:
1. Go to the send new invoice tab in the Invoices center.
2. Enter any number of Line Items in the Goods and Services section. (See Entering One‐time Invoices above.)
NOTE: Be certain that the Qty, Tax 1 and Tax 2 are completed as you would like them to be saved for each
Line Item.)
3. Click “saved lists of items” in the header bar.
4. Click “save current list” in the drop‐down box.
NOTE: If you already have saved lists in your system, you will see them listed above the “save current list”
link.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 281
5. The Save Current List pop‐up appears.
6. Leave the “Save as a New List” radio button selected, and enter a short name for the list in the field. This is
the name that will appear in the “saved lists of items” drop‐down box. Your customers will not see this
name.
7. Click the “save list” button to save the list, or click the “cancel” button to discard it.
8. You are returned to the send new invoice screen. The next time you click the “save lists of items” link, you
will see the new list in the drop‐down box.
9. Repeat steps 2‐7 to save additional Lists of Items.
You can create new Lists of Items based on existing Lists of Items instead of entering
individual item lists each time.
To do this, retrieve a saved list (See Retrieving Lists of Items below), make changes‐‐ 
such as changing the tax from Colorado tax to New Jersey tax‐ ‐then save as a new List
of Items.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 282
Editing Lists of Items
When you save a new List of Items you can save over an existing list. Doing this will completely replace the Line
Items in that list with the set of Line Items currently active in the Goods and Services section of the send new
invoice screen.
To edit a List of Items, follow the steps below:
1. Go to the send new invoice tab in the Invoices center.
2. Populate the Goods and Services section with Line Items.
• Manually enter any number of Line Items. (See Entering One‐time Invoices above.)
• Retrieve a saved list of Line Items (See Retrieving Lists of Items below) and edit as appropriate.
NOTE: Be certain that the Qty, Tax 1 and Tax 2 are completed as you would like them to be saved for
each Line Item.
In the example below, we have loaded the “5 rgb widget‐‐co tax” list used in the previous section and
added a Line Item for “Square Red Widget.”.
3. Click the “saved lists of items” link in the header bar.
4. In the drop‐down list, click “save current list.”
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 283
5. The Save Current List pop‐up appears.
6. Select the “Replace an Existing List” radio button, and select the list you want to replace from the drop‐
down box.
7. Click the “save list” button to save the change and replace the Line Items in the list with the ones in the
currently active invoice. Or, click the “cancel” button to discard the changes.
8. The next time you select the List of Items, it will populate your invoice using the new Line Items.
Retrieving Lists of Items
You can retrieve a List of Items when entering any new invoice or invoice schedule. To do this, follow the steps
below.
1. Go to the send new invoice tab in the Invoices center.
2. Select a Customer, enter Invoice # and schedule details if appropriate.
If you begin manually entering Line Items in the Goods and Services section, and then
select a saved List of Items, the items in the list will overwrite any manual entries. It
will not add the saved List Items to what you have already entered.
However, once you load a List of items into the invoice, you can add additional Line
Items as required.
Chapter 5: Invoices : Invoice Line Items 284
3. Click the “saved lists of items” link to open the drop‐down list.
4. Click on the saved list you want to use.
5. The Goods and Services section of the invoice will refresh and all of the Line Items in the saved list will be
populated.
NOTE: If the drop‐down list does not close by itself, click anywhere on the screen to close it.
6. You can now make any changes to these Line Items and/or add additional Line Items to the invoice. Any
changes you make for this individual invoice will not be saved to the List of Items.
NOTE: If you want to retain the changes, you can overwrite the existing List of Items (see Editing Lists of
Items) or save it as a new List of Items (see Saving Lists of Items).

Chapter 6: Customers : Importing a Customer Batch 295
Importing a Customer Batch
Using the import function is a fast and easy way to transfer customers from any external system into ADP Payments.
With a few simple steps you can transfer any customer database, including company, name, billing address, shipping
address, email, phone contacts, and even bank accounts and credit card accounts to ADP Payments where all data is
securely stored and available for invoicing and payment processing.
Imports in ADP Payments require that you create an import file based on import type specifications, and then
upload that file into ADP Payments and map your fields to system fields. Detailed field requirements for customer
imports, as well as all ADP Payments imports, can be found in Appendix C: Import Requirements.
This section covers how to import customer batches. For more information on the ADP Payments Import Center,
and batch status and error reporting, see Import Center in Chapter 8.
The following are the basic steps to take when importing a customer batch into ADP Payments.
1. Create your Customer import file.
2. Upload the file into ADP Payments on the Settings‐‐> Import Center screen.
3. Map fields from your file to ADP Payments system fields.
4. Review your field mapping.
5. Submit the Customer import file for processing.
6. View the results of the import.
The following sections walk you through all of these steps.
Currently ADP Paymentssupports only U.S. and Canadian addresses. You cannot import
customers with addresses in any other country.
Be sure to prepare your import batch file properly.   See the Customer Import
Requirements section in Appendix for detailed requirements and field parameters for
Customer import batches.
Chapter 6: Customers : Importing a Customer Batch 296
CREATING A CUSTOMER IMPORT FILE
ADP Payments import files must be in .csv (comma delimited text) format or pipe delimited text format. All fields,
including date fields must be formatted as text fields. All credit card account numbers must be entered as number
strings without any dashes or spaces.
You can use column headers in your file. (You can also upload files without file headers.) You do not need to use the
ADP Payments field names in your file header row. Use field names you will easily recognize, since you will be
mapping these fields to ADP Payments system fields during the import process.
For more information on proper formatting of ADP Payments import files, see Appendix C: Import Requirements. For
details specific to Customer imports, see the Customer Import Requirements section in Appendix
When creating new customers you must include all required fields for a Customer Record. For a complete list and
description of all fields available in a new customer import see Customer Import Requirements in Appendix
The following fields are required for all new customer imports:
• First Name
• Last Name
• Billing Address 1   
• City
• State/Province
• Zip/Postal Code
The following are optional fields that can be included (See Customer Import Requirements in Appendix for detailed
field specifications.):
• Billing Address 2
• Country
NOTE: If this field is not mapped, or the row does not include a value for it, it will default to “USA.”
• Phone and Alt. Phone
• Email and Alt. Email
• Website
• Shipping Address and Contact Information
• Primary Credit Card Account
• Primary Bank Account
• Note
Do not use commas in any of the fields when creating a .csv import file.  Doing so will
corrupt your data and cause values to be mapped to the wrong fields.  For example,
you should never enter a company name as “ABC Company, Inc.”  Instead, enter “ABC
Company Inc.”
Chapter 6: Customers : Importing a Customer Batch 297
• Customer Custom Fields
• Account #
NOTE: If you are importing customers from another system, and you want to update that system with
information from ADP Payments, use that system’s key (or unique customer identification number) in
the Account # field.
A sample new customer Payment import file created in Excel is shown below:
The easiest way to create and save your Customer import file is to create it in Excel, and then export it as a .csv file.  
To do this, use the “save as” function in Excel, and select “comma delimited csv” as the file type.
When entering numeric values in a Customer import file, such as zip codes, credit card
number, bank account routing numbers and bank account numbers, you should enter
them as text strings.   To do this, enter an apostrophe (‘) before the number.  This tells
Excel to treat the number as a text string, and it will not remove leading zeros or
change any component of the string.
For example, to enter the zip code 07666 enter: ‘07666
To enter the credit card number 5454545454545454, enter: ‘5454545454545454.
Once you save an Excel file as a .csv file, it is very important that you do not open or
edit the .csv file in Excel prior to importing it into ADP Payments. Doing this will corrupt
the file and cause import errors.
If you need to make a change to the data in your file, open the Excel file, edit the file
and then use the “save as” function again to save the edited file in .csv format.
Chapter 6: Customers : Importing a Customer Batch 298
UPLOADING A CUSTOMER IMPORT FILE
Once you have created your Customer import file, you’re ready to import it into ADP Payments. Step‐by‐step
instructions are provided below.
1. Click Customers in side navigation.
2. At the top of the Customers screen click the “import” link, as shown below:
3. The Import Center dashboard appears, as shown below.   
4. From the top section select “Customers” as the Import type.
5. Enter a short descriptive name for your import in the Import name field.  This  name will be used when
referencing this particular import batch in tables on the Import Center dashboard.
6. Enter a short description of the import in the Import description field.
7. In the File type drop‐down box select the type of file you will be importing. You can use a .csv file
(recommended) or a pipe‐delimited text file.
NOTE: To convert an Excel file to .csv, simply use the “save as” command and select .csv as the file type.
8. If the file you are importing contains a header row, check the First row is header checkbox. (Using a header
row is very helpful for the field mapping that you will perform in Step 12.)   If there is no header row, leave
this box unchecked.
9. Click the “Choose File” button to locate the import batch file on your computer.
10. Click “upload” to begin the import process.
Chapter 6: Customers : Importing a Customer Batch 299
11. The system will perform a preliminary validation of your file. If it is corrupt or unusable, you will see an
error message. Otherwise, you will see the Field Mapping screen, shown below:   
• The first column displays the values in the first row of each column in your file. These will either be the
values in your header row, or the first row of data (if your file does not contain a header row).
• The second column contains drop‐down boxes used to map a field in your file to a system field.
• The Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box enables you to select a saved mapping schema. (See
About Saved Mapping Schemes in Chapter 8 for instructions on using saved mappings.)
• The “reset mapping” button will clear all values in the System Field Names drop‐down boxes so that
you can begin the mapping process again.
• The help box, located under the “reset mapping” button provides definitions for all of the ADP
Payments system fields. Select a field name from the drop‐down, and its definition will appear under
the box.
Chapter 6: Customers : Importing a Customer Batch 300
12. For each column you want to map from your file, select a corresponding ADP Payments field from the
associated drop‐down box, as shown below. If you do not want to map a field from your file, leave the
corresponding drop‐down box set to “‐Select Column‐.”
NOTE: Fields that you select will disappear from the list of available options. This will prevent you from
accidentally creating duplicate mappings.    
• The following fields are required for a customer import batch (you must supply mappings for them):
• First Name
• Last Name
• Billing Address 1
• City
• State/Province
• Zip/Postal Code
NOTE: If you do not map the Country field, or if the row does not contain a value for it, the field
will default to “USA.”
13. When you have finished mapping fields, click the “continue” button.
14. On the next screen, shown below, enter a name for the mapping you just created in the Mapping Name
field. You can select this mapping at a later date from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box to quickly
map a file using the same column structure.
NOTE: You are required to save your mapping. Even if you never expect to use it again, storing it will save
time if there is an error processing your import file and you need to upload your file again.   
15. Enter a Description for the mapping. This is an optional field.
Chapter 6: Customers : Importing a Customer Batch 301
16. Click the “save & continue” button.

Chapter 6: Customers : Using the Customer ID 303
Using the Customer ID
Every customer in your ADP Payments system is assigned a Customer ID. The Customer ID is a unique identifier for
the customer in the system, and is included on receipts, recurring payment schedule notifications, and transaction
details. The Customer ID can be used in many ways. You can:
• Easily locate customers in ADP Payments by entering the Customer ID in any customer Search field.
NOTE: Have your customers reference their Customer ID when calling you or mailing payments.
• Include the Customer ID in all ADP Payments email correspondence with your customers, so
customers will always have it handy. (See Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for how to edit
email templates to include the Customer ID.)
NOTE: Receipts, Recurring Payment Schedule Notifications, and Transaction Details emails all include
the Customer ID by default.
• Use the Customer ID as the ADP Payments record key (unique customer identifier) when transferring
ADP Payments customer data into other systems.
NOTE: Include the Customer ID field in all reports that you will be exporting for integration with other
systems. Also, create a field for it in your external systems to establish a common point of reference
with ADP Payments.
• Import one‐time payments for processing in ADP Payments by referencing the Customer ID. When you
do this, you can process payments for customers without having to enter or upload payment account
information each time. (See Importing Payments for Existing Customers in Chapter 4 for instructions on
how to do this.)
• Import recurring payment schedules into ADP Payments by referencing the Customer ID. When you do
this you can create bill payment and payment plan schedules for customers without having to enter or
upload payment account information each time. (See Importing Recurring Payment Schedules for
Existing Customers in Chapter 4 for how to do this.)
The ADP Payments Customer ID is not included in any of the standard customer or payment tables, but you can
easily locate it in the following places:
1. On the view Customer Details screen:   
Chapter 6: Customers : Using the Customer ID 304
2. On the Edit Customer Details screen:   
3. In the Customer Information section on any Transaction Details screen.
NOTE: The Customer ID is linked on the Transaction Details screen. Clicking it takes you to the View
Customer Details screen.   
4. In any standard or custom report that includes the Customer ID field. All standard reports contain the
Customer ID field. You can add the Customer ID field to any custom report. (See Creating Custom Reports in
Chapter 7 for instructions on how to do this.) The Customer ID is also the only customer identifier on
exports of payment history and invoice history.
NOTE: See Exporting the Customer List for instructions on how to export your Customer list, which includes
the Customer ID.
Chapter 6: Customers : Managing Customers 305
Managing Customers
When you click the “Customers” button in side navigation, you are brought to the manage customers tab, which
contains the Customers table. The default table view displays a list of all your customers, 10 at a time, sorted in
alphabetical order by Last name.   The last summary line of the table tells you how many customers you have. You
can navigate through your customer list by using the linked numbers under the customer list portion of table. You
can export the entire customer list by clicking the “export” link.   
NOTE: If there is not enough room to display the full field value, you will see the first portion of the entry followed by
ellipses (...). Hover your mouse over the truncated value to see the complete entry.
You can access edit, view profile, view transactions, collect payment, send invoice, and delete functions from the
Action menu for each transaction. To do this, click the Action button, then click on the function you want to perform
from the menu.
You can adjust this view by clicking the linked table headings to sort alpha‐numerically by Company Name, First
Name, Last Name, City, State/Province, Phone or Email.  Clicking once sorts from A/blank ‐to‐Z (low‐to‐high),
clicking a second time sorts from Z‐to‐A/blank (high‐to‐low).

You can tell which column is controlling the sort by looking for an arrow next to the linked column header. An arrow
in the down direction indicates that the current sort is Z‐to‐A (high‐to‐low) for that column. An arrow in the up
direction indicates that the current sort is A‐to‐Z (low‐to‐high) for that column. Clicking the arrow will reverse the
sort. For example, in the screen capture below, the table is sorted A‐to‐Z by Last Name.   
You can also search for an individual customer in the table instead of navigating through a sorted list. Once you have
located a customer, you can view the record, edit the record, manage the customer’s stored credit cards and bank
accounts, reset the customer’s Customer Portal password, send an invoice or invoice schedule to the customer,
collect a payment or enter a recurring payment schedule for the customer, or delete the customer.
The next sections provide instructions on how to perform these functions.
EXPORTING THE CUSTOMER LIST
You can export your entire customer list as a .csv (comma delimited text) file that can be opened in Excel, or can be
imported into any other software system that accepts .csv imports. This file contains full customer information as
well as the ADP Payments Customer ID. So, it is ideal for integrating ADP Payments Customer records and
Transaction records with other programs, as the Customer ID can be used as a unique database “Key.”
The export file will contain all of the records included in the Customers table. The only filtering option for this table
is to select a single customer‐‐ so you effectively have the option to export one customer record or all customer
records.
The following sections describe how to export the file and define each column in the export.
How to Export Your Customer List
Follow the steps below to export your customer list to a .csv file.
1. Go to the Customers screen.
2. Click the “clear search” link to make sure your table is unfiltered.
When you export the customer file you will have a choice to open it or to save it. If you
select “open” the file will typically open in Excel. However, because this is a .csv file
Excel will often corrupt the data‐‐ for example by removing leading zeros on zip codes
and displaying phone numbers in exponential notation.
If you want to use your export in Excel, the best practice is to save the .csv file to your
hard drive. Then open a new workbook in Excel and import the .csv file. During the
import process you can designate fields such as phone numbers and zip codes as “text”
fields instead of number fields so that your data is not corrupted.
For detailed instructions on how to import .csv files into Excel, consult the Excel Help
files.
Chapter 6: Customers : Managing Customers 307
3. Click the “export” link at the very top of the table, as shown:
4. Depending on your browser, you will have the option to open and/or save the file.
  a. To open the file, click the “Open” button in the dialog box. In most cases (unless you have your system
default csv files to a different program), the file will open in Excel, but will not be saved. You will need
to save the file if you want to store it on your computer.
  b. To save the file to your computer:
  i. Click the “Save” button in the dialog box.   
Chapter 6: Customers : Managing Customers 308
  ii. A Save As dialog box opens.
NOTE: In Google Chrome, and some other browsers, clicking the “csv” link will automatically save
the file to your Downloads folder. You can open it from the browser “Downloads” bar or access it
from the Downloads folder later.
  iii. Enter a name for your file, and select a location on your computer where you want to save the file.
  iv. Click the “Save” button.
  v. You can now open the export at any time, or import it into an Excel file or other application
software.
Field Definitions for the Customer Export File
The customer export file is not customizable. All exports contain the same set of fields, with the same field names in
the same order. These fields are defined in the table below.
NOTE: Custom Fields and payment account fields (credit cards and bank accounts) are not included in customer list
exports.

Chapter 6: Customers : Managing Customers 316
MANAGING CUSTOMER USER IDS AND PASSWORDS
Your ADP Payments system not only enables you and your staff to manage invoices and payments for customers, it
also includes a Customer Portal that allows your customers to pay your invoices, manage the address and payment
account information you store for them, and view their invoice and payments history with your company.
Additionally, your customers can initiate one‐time payments and create recurring payment schedulesthemselves via
ADP Payments web payment pages you create.
While it is not required that customers enroll in Customer Portal or create ADP Payments accounts in order to make
online payments for invoices and via web payment pages, doing so enables them to retrieve saved account
information and view history.
To learn all about the ADP Payments features and functions available to your customers via Customer Portal and
web payment pages, see Appendix E: Customer Portal.
The User ID
In order to access Customer Portal or to login and retrieve stored information for web payment pages, your
customers must have a User ID and Password for ADP Payments.
The first time a customer attempts to access your Customer Portal they will be asked to create a User ID and a
password. Once they do this, you will see the User ID chosen by your customer on the View Customer Details
screen.
Once your customer has chosen a User ID it cannot be changed, by either you or the customer.
When you delete a customer (see Deleting A Customer) you remove all access to Customer Portal.
User IDs must be unique in your ADP Payments system. No two customers can have the
same User ID. If a customer attempts to save a User ID that already exists in your
system they will see an error message, as shown below:
Additionally, User IDs must be at least 6 characters and contain only letters, numbers, a
period, a dash and the @ sign.
Chapter 6: Customers : Managing Customers 317
Resetting a Customer Password
Just like your own company’s ADP Payments system, where users are responsible for their own passwords, your
customers will be primarily responsible for managing their own Customer Portal passwords. Customers will set the
initial password during the enrollment process. (See Appendix E: Customer Portal.) They will be able to manually
reset their passwords using a “change password” link. And, they will be able to retrieve a forgotten password by
using a “forgot password?” link.
However, in the event that your customers get locked‐out of their accounts, or if they simply call you to reset a
password instead of doing it themselves, you can reset the password for them.
This can be done from either the View Customer Details screen or the Edit Customer Details screen.    
1. Click the “reset customer’s password” or “reset password” link.
2. A pop‐up box will appear explaining the password reset process. Click “ok” to continue and reset the
password. Or, click “cancel” to leave the password as is.
3. A success message will appear confirming the password reset. Click “ok” to close it.
4. An email message will be sent to the Email address on the Customer Record. Your customer can use the
temporary password in the email to login to the system once. After entering the temporary password, the
customer will be required to create a new personal password.
Chapter 6: Customers : Managing Customers 318
MANAGING CUSTOMER PAYMENT ACCOUNTS
You can store multiple credit cards for each customer, as well as multiple bank accounts. (Note that your system may
not be enabled for both payment types.) You can add new cards/accounts while entering new payments and
recurring payment schedules. (See New Payments and Schedules in Chapter 4.)
Each Customer Record contains one default Credit Card and one default Bank Account. The first account added for
each payment type is automatically assigned as the default. The default account is used for all payment and
payment schedule imports. It is also selected automatically on the collect new payment screen and for all online
payments. (A different account can always be selected for use with the transaction instead of the default account.)
Credit Card and bank accounts can also be saved in ADP Payments as part of imports. When importing a Customer
batch, you can include one credit card account and one bank account with the Customer Record. (See Importing a
Customer Batch above.)
When importing a payment batch, you can include an individual payment account (either credit card or bank
account, depending on payment type) that will be saved in ADP Payments. (See Importing One‐time Payments in
Chapter 4.)
You can also add cards/accounts from the Edit Customer Details screen, as well as editing and deleting existing
cards/accounts, and setting or changing the default account.  The following sections cover how to do this.
Credit Cards
When entering a customer for the first time, the Credit Card Accounts section is displayed in new‐card‐entry mode,
as shown below. It will remain in this format until the first credit card is added to the account.    
The password reset email will be sent to the email address saved in the Email field of
the Customer Record. If your customer claims not to have received the password reset
email, double check that you have the email address entered correctly.
If the email address is correct, have your customer check email SPAM folders for the
password reset email. On occasion some email programs will mistakenly identify this
email as SPAM.

About Default Payment Accounts
Each Customer Record can contain one default credit card and one default bank account, as well as an unlimited
number of non‐default accounts.  
You can always tell which account is the default, as it is designated with a check mark in the Default column in the
credit card accounts /Echeck (ACH) accounts table on the Edit Customer Details screen.
The default account is used in the following ways:
• It is automatically selected in the Use column when its payment type is selected on the collect new
payment screen.
• It is automatically selected in the Use column when its payment type is selected on a web payment
form or on an online invoice payment form.
• When you import a payment batch using an Existing Customer row (with a Customer ID) the default
account is used to process the payment. (See Importing Payments for Existing Customers in Chapter 4.)
• When you import a recurring payment schedule batch using an Existing Customer row (with a
Customer ID) the default account is attached to the schedule. (See Uploading a Recurring Payment
Import File for Existing Customers in Chapter 4.)
The first credit card entered for a customer is automatically set as the default credit card. The first bank account
entered for a customer is automatically set as the default bank account. This occurs whether you add the account
yourself via the ADP Payments application or whether your customer adds it via Customer Portal, or while paying an
online invoice or via a web payment form.

Chapter 7: Reports 341
Chapter 7:  Reports
From the Reports center you can create, view, and export details about the transactions processed in your ADP
Payments account. The Reports dashboard provides a graphic snapshot of activity by transaction type, as well as one
click access to all of the reports in your account. The standard reports section provides two reports that cover all
your transaction activity. In the custom reports section, you can create your own filters and set your own field
displays to view and export transaction data as needed to meet your specific business needs.
In addition to viewing reports from the Reports center, you can use the Reports Quick Links in side navigation to
view any standard or custom report.
The following sections describe each reporting function in detail.
You can also access transaction reporting from the manage payments screen.  
However, the Reports center is the only place where you can export transaction data.  
Additionally, using custom reporting in the Reports center provides greater control over
data filtering and the fields included in reports.
Chapter 7: Reports : The Reports Dashboard 342
The Reports Dashboard
To access reporting, click Reports in the side navigation bar. When you do this, the center will open to the Reports
dashboard, as shown:        
The dashboard contains three sections: snapshots, standard reports, and custom reports, each of which is
described in detail in the following sections.
Chapter 7: Reports : The Reports Dashboard 343
SNAPSHOTS
The snapshots section, located at the top of the Reports dashboard, provides a graphical depiction of transaction
activity in your account by transaction type. These charts and the underlying data filters are not editable. Each time
you view the Reports dashboard they are created as static graphics, which cannot be clicked to enlarge or drill down
into data values.   
The Transactions this month by payment type pie chart breaks down transactions by number for both ACH and
credit card, as follows:
• The pie chart reflects the combined total number of transactions processed in your account for the
current calendar month. Place your mouse over each section of the pie for the exact number and
percentage of transactions represented.
• The brown section represents that total number of credit card transactions and the blue section
represents the total number of ACH transactions.
The Daily transactions by payment type line graph breaks down transactions by dollar amount for both ACH and
Credit Card in the current month, as follows:
• The X axis contains individual days of the month. The chart will skip individual days as the month gets
longer in order to fit in the display area. However, values for every day of the month will still be
reflected in the chart.
• The Y axis represents the total dollar value of transactions processed on an individual day.
• The brown line represents credit card transactions and the blue line represents ACH transactions.
The charts will change dynamically as transactions are processed in your account. They will reset on the first day of
each month.
Chapter 7: Reports : The Reports Dashboard 344
STANDARD REPORTS TABLE
The standard reports table contains the four standard reports available in ADP Payments. You cannot add standard
reports to this table, or edit the reports.
The first column of the table contains the linked Report name. Click the linked Report name to open the report.
Once the report is open, you can view and sort the data, as well as export it.   (See Standard Reports below for
details on each standard report.)
You can add a Reports Quick Link for a standard report by clicking the “Add Quick Link” link in the Action menu. (See
Reports Quick Links for instructions.)
NOTE: Standard reports are included in the Reports Quick Link list by default. If you remove one from the list, you
can use the add Action to restore it.
You can also clone a standard report for use as the basis of a new custom report by clicking the “Clone” link in the
Action menu. (See Cloning Standard Reports below for instructions.)
NOTE: The Web Payment Form Transactions and Recurring Payments with Expiring Credit Cards reports cannot be
cloned.
CUSTOM REPORTS TABLE
The custom reports table contains a list of all of the custom reports that you and other users in your account have
created. The table displays 10 rows at a time, and lists the oldest reports first. If there are more than 10 custom
reports, click the linked page numbers at the bottom of the table to navigate through the table results.
Chapter 7: Reports : The Reports Dashboard 345
The table columns are defined below. You can click either of the linked column headers to re‐sort the table results
based on that column, as follows:
• Report name‐‐ This is the name assigned to the custom report when it was created. Clicking the linked
column header sorts alphabetically by Report name. Click once to sort from A‐to‐Z, and click again to
sort from Z‐to‐A.
• Created on‐‐ This field displays the date the report was last saved‐‐ not the date on which it was
originally created.   Clicking the linked column header sorts the reports in chronological order.  Click
once to sort from oldest‐to‐newest, and click again to sort from newest‐to‐oldest.
• Subscription‐‐ This field indicates whether you or any other user has programmed ADP Payments to
automatically email the report. If there is no subscription the field will contain a line. If a subscription
has been created, the email frequency will be displayed in this field. (See Subscribing to Custom
Reports below for more details on custom report subscriptions.) This field is not sortable.
• Created by‐‐ This field displays the User ID of the person who initially created the custom report. It is
not a sortable field.
NOTE: You can edit custom reports created by other users if your assigned ADP Payments Role enables
editing reports. However, editing a report created by another user will not change the Created by User
ID to your own.
• Action menu‐‐ The final column in the table contains the Action menu. Click the Action button then
click on the link for the function you want to use. Links in this menu can be used to edit, export,
subscribe, add quick link, and delete reports. (See Custom Reports below for detailed explanations for
each of these functions.)
You will always know which column is being used to sort the table, and whether the
sort is from high‐to‐low or low‐to‐high by looking for the arrow indicators next to the
column headers, as shown below:
Chapter 7: Reports : Reports Quick Links 346
Reports Quick Links
The Reports Quick Links menu in side navigation (shown to the left) provides easy
access to standard and custom reports you use frequently.
Simply click a linked report name, and the report will open in view mode. You can
adjust date filters while viewing the report, as well as export the report in Excel
(.xls), Acrobat (.pdf), or comma delimited text (.csv) format by using the export links
at the top‐right of the report.
All standard reports are included in the list by default. You can add custom reports
to the list as you create them.
NOTE: If you delete a custom report for which you have added a Quick Link the link
will be automatically removed from the list.
To remove a report from the list, click the “x” box to the right of the report name.
To add a report to the list (either a new custom report, or a standard report that you have previously removed),
follow the steps below:
1. Go to the Reports Dashboard by clicking the Reports button in side navigation.
2. Locate the report you want to add in either the standard reports table or the custom reports table.
3. Click the Action button associated with the report, then click “Add Quick Link.”
4. You will now see the report in the Reports Quick Links list.
NOTE: If the report name is too long for the side bar, it will be abbreviated
with ellipses. Mouse over the link to see the full report name.
Chapter 7: Reports : Standard Reports 347
Standard Reports
ADP Payments includes four standard reports:
• All Transactions‐‐ Includes every transaction processed in your ADP Payments account, regardless of
status (successful and unsuccessful).
• Settled Transactions‐‐ Includes all transactions in your account with a status of “settled.”
• Web Payment Form Transactions‐‐ Includes all one‐time transactions entered via your ADP Payments
Web Payment Pages, regardless of status (successful and unsuccessful).   
• Recurring Payments with Expiring Credit Cards‐‐ Includes a list of customers with recurring payment
schedules that have a credit card attached to them as a payment method which expires in the time
frame you select.
You can access a report by clicking the linked Report name in the standard reports table.   
All standard reports, and the filter and export options available for them, are described in detail in the next sections.
Chapter 7: Reports : Standard Reports 348
ALL TRANSACTIONS REPORT
The All Transactions standard report contains a row for each transaction processed or attempted in your ADP
Payments system, including transactions that failed. The default report view shows all types of transactions from the
most recent 90 days. When you are done viewing the report, click the “back to report summary” link at the bottom
of the screen to return to the Reports dashboard.
A SNAPSHOT of activity appears above the table. The SNAPSHOT covers only the filtered data in the table report.
Thus, the values in the snapshot will change as you change the date range and payment methods filters for the
report.
The SNAPSHOT provides a total number and dollar amount for the following payment statuses:
• Settled Transactions‐‐ Successful payments with a status of “settled” for which you have received
funds in your bank account.
NOTE: Funds may not appear in your bank account until several days after ADP Payments records them
as settled. This is a reporting issue related to your bank.
• Unsettled transactions‐‐ Payments that have been successfully submitted for processing, but have not
yet settled. You have not yet received funds in your bank account for these transactions. Transactions
with a status of “Authorized” and “Posted” are included in this sum.
NOTE: It is possible that your customers will see the funds debited from their accounts for these
transactions, even though you have not yet received the funds.
Chapter 7: Reports : Standard Reports 349
• Unsuccessful transactions‐‐ Payments that were not successfully processed, were disputed by your
customers, or payments that you voided. Transactions with a status of “Voided,” “Returned,”
“Returned NSF,” “Chargeback,” and “Failed” are included in this sum.
The transaction table displays 10 rows at a time, and lists the newest transactions within the date range first. Click
the linked page numbers at the bottom of the table to navigate through the table results.
You can click any of the column headers to re‐sort the table results based on that column, as follows:
• Customer ID‐‐ Each customer in your ADP Payments system is assigned a unique Customer ID. You can
sort the report by Customer ID. Click once to sort from high‐to‐low (newest /most recently added
customers to oldest customers), click again to sort from low‐to‐high (oldest customers to newest
customers).
The Customer ID is linked in the All Transactions report. Clicking the linked Customer ID opens the
Customer Record in view mode. (See Viewing Customer Records in Chapter 6.)
NOTE: When you click the linked Customer ID from any report, a “back to report” link at the bottom of
the Customer Details screen will take you back to the report you were viewing prior to opening the
screen.
• Account #‐‐ If an Account # was included for the customer when it was created, that number will be
displayed in this field. If no Account # was assigned, the field will be blank. You can sort the field alpha‐
numerically, with blank being the lowest. Click once to sort from high‐to‐blank. Click again to sort from
blank‐to‐high.
NOTE: Account # is an optional field. However, it is very useful when integrating ADP Payments with
your other systems. The Account # field is included in this report, so you can use it as a key when
exporting data from ADP Payments and importing it into another system.
• Transaction ID‐‐ The Transaction ID is a unique identifier ADP Payments assigns to each payment
processed by the system. (The Transaction ID is called the Confirm. # in the View one‐time payment
history table.) Transaction IDs are assigned to all payments, including failed payments. Click once to
sort from high‐to‐low (newest‐to‐oldest), click again to sort from low‐to‐high (oldest‐to‐newest).
The Transaction ID is linked in the All Transactions report. Clicking the linked Transaction ID opens the
Transaction Details page for the payment. (See Viewing Transaction Details in Chapter 4.)
NOTE: When you click the linked Transaction ID from any report, a “back to report” link at the bottom
of the Transaction Details screen will take you back to the report you were viewing prior to opening
the screen.
• Amount‐‐ The dollar amount of the payment. Payments are sorted numerically by dollar amount. Click
once to sort from low‐to‐high, and click again to sort from high‐to‐low.
• Enter Date‐‐ The date the transaction was entered or generated. Transactions are sorted
chronologically by enter date. Click once to sort from oldest‐to‐newest, and click again to sort from
newest‐to‐oldest. (The default table view is sorted from newest‐to‐oldest.)
Chapter 7: Reports : Standard Reports 350
• Status‐‐ Each ADP Paymentstransaction statusis defined below. Transactions are sorted alphabetically.
Click once to sort from Z‐to‐A, and click again to sort from A‐to‐Z.
• All Payments: The default view when you open the manage payments screen. Click the “clear
search” link to return to this view. Or, select “All” in the filters list.
• Authorized Payments: Credit card payments that have been authorized, but not yet submitted for
processing.
• Pending Payments: The initial stage for every transaction sent for authorization. The system
assigns this status while waiting for an authorization response. In some rare cases, if
communication is disrupted before the system gets a response, the transaction will remain in the
“Pending” status.
NOTE: If you see a credit card transaction with a status of “Pending” you can be assured that it
failed and was not submitted for processing. For ACH transactions, wait until the Expected Settle
Date to see if the transaction has settled or returned. If not, contact ADP Payments Customer Care
so that we can determine the actual status for the transaction.
• Posted Payments: Credit Card and ACH payments that have been entered in the system, but not
yet settled.
• Settled Payments: Successful payments for which you have received funds and successful credits
when the funds have been debited from your account. For settled payments, the Amount paid will
be green in the table. (Settled credits will continue to show the Amount in (red).)
• Failed Payments: Attempted payments that were never authorized.
• Voided Payments: Any payment that was voided prior to it being submitted for processing.
• Refunded Payments: A transaction that has been reversed (refunded). When you issue a refund
for a settled transaction, the status of that transaction changes to “Refunded.”
• Refund (Posted) Payments: The credit transaction generated when a settled transaction is
refunded or when you process a standalone refund. The dollar value of this transaction will appear
as negative and in red. i.e. ($5.00).
• Refund (Settled) Payments: A settled refund transaction. When funds have been deducted from
your account for a “Refund (Posted)” payment, the status changes to “Refund (Settled).”
• Returned Payments: ACH payments that were unsuccessful for any reason other than non‐
sufficient funds or chargeback. The Reason Description field on the Transaction Detailsscreen will
display a return code for this payment, and there will be an entry in the Return Date field for the
date the return was recorded.(See Appendix B: ACH Return Codes for more information on ACH
Returns.)
• Returned NSF Payments: An ACH transaction that failed because your customer had insufficient
funds in the account to cover the payment. The Reason Description field on the Transaction
Details screen will display an R01 return code for this payment, and there will be an entry in the
Return Date field for the date the return was recorded.
NOTE: You can manually re‐process this payment again to attempt to collect.
• Chargeback Payments: A payment being disputed by your customer.
NOTE: Only ACH Chargebacks are currently recorded in ADP Payments. Credit Card Chargebacks
are reported to you by your merchant processing company directly, and are handled completely
outside the system, thus their status is not updated to “Chargeback” in ADP Payments.
Chapter 7: Reports : Standard Reports 351
• Transaction Type‐‐ Each ADP Payments transaction type is defined below. Transactions are sorted
alphabetically. Click once to sort from Z‐to‐A, and click again to sort from A‐to‐Z.

• MOTO‐‐Master‐‐ Any card‐not‐present MasterCard transaction.
• MOTO‐‐Visa‐‐ Any card‐not‐present Visa transaction.
• Invoice #‐‐ The invoice number assigned to the payment. It is the invoice number you enter for one‐
time payments, the invoice number for a one‐time invoice, or the system generated invoice number
for payment of invoices that are part of recurring invoice schedules.   If you did not provide an invoice
number for a particular payment, this field will be blank. The sort on this column is alphanumeric, with
blanks appearing at the low end. Click once to sort Z‐to‐Blank. Click again to sort Blank‐to‐Z.
• Cust. last name‐‐ The last name of your customer. The sort is alphabetical. Click once to sort A‐to‐Z,
click again to sort Z‐to‐A.
You can change the date filter on the report by selecting a new date range in the Dated within drop‐down area. (See
Filtering Standard Reports By Date below.)
The default payment method filter is to display all transactions (even though it displays “custom” in the box.) You
can change the filter by selecting a specific transaction type or types in the Payment Methods drop‐down area. (See
Filtering Standard Reports By Payment Method below.)
You can also export the report in both Excel and Adobe Acrobat.pdf format. (See Exporting Standard Reports below.)
Chapter 7: Reports : Standard Reports 352
SETTLED TRANSACTIONS REPORT
The Settled Transactions standard report contains a row for each transaction that has been successfully processed
and settled in your ADP Payments account. The report filters on Status = “Settled” so successful refund transactions
with a status of “Refund (Settled)” are not included in this report.
NOTE: Funds may not appear in your bank account until several days after ADP Payments records them as settled.
This is a reporting issue related to your bank.
The default report view shows transactions from the most recent 90 days for all payment methods. When you are
done viewing the report, click the “back to report summary” link at the bottom of the screen to return to the
Reports dashboard.   
A SNAPSHOT of activity appears above the table. The Settled transactions portion of the SNAPSHOT provides a total
number and dollar amount for the settled transactions included in the report. As this report only contains settled
transactions, the Unsettled transactions section will always be 0. The SNAPSHOT covers only the filtered data in the
table report. Thus, the values in the snapshot will change as you change the date range and payment methods filters
for the report.
The transaction table displays 10 rows at a time, and lists the newest transactions within the date range first. Click
the linked page numbers at the bottom of the table to navigate through the table results.    
Chapter 7: Reports : Standard Reports 353
You can click any of the column headers to re‐sort the table results based on that column, as follows:

WEB PAYMENT FORM TRANSACTIONS REPORT
The Web Payment Form Transactions standard report contains a row for each one‐time transaction that has been
attempted via any of your Web Payment Pages. The report does not include any payments generated by recurring
payment schedules entered via Web Payment Pages‐‐ even if the first transaction in the schedule was processed on
the same day it was entered.
The default report view shows one‐time transactions of all types entered via your web payment forms from the
most recent 90 days. When you are done viewing the report, click the “back to report summary” link at the bottom
of the screen to return to the Reports dashboard.
A SNAPSHOT of activity appears above the table.The SNAPSHOT covers only the filtered data in the table report.
Thus, values in the snapshot will change as you change the date range and payment methods filters for the report.
The SNAPSHOT provides a total number and dollar amount for the following payment statuses:
• Settled Transactions‐‐ Successful payments with a status of “settled” for which you have received
funds in your bank account.
NOTE: Funds may not appear in your bank account until several days after ADP Payments records them
as settled. This is a reporting issue related to your bank.
• Unsettled transactions‐‐ Payments that have been successfully submitted for processing, but have not
yet settled. You have not yet received funds in your bank account for these transactions. Transactions
with a status of “Authorized” and “Posted” are included in this sum.
NOTE: It is possible that your customers will see the funds debited from their accounts for these
transactions, even though you have not yet received the funds.
• Unsuccessful transactions‐‐ Payments that were not successfully processed, were disputed by your
customers, or payments that you voided. Transactions with a status of “Voided,” “Returned,”
“Chargeback,” and “Failed” are included in this sum.

FILTERING STANDARD REPORTS BY DATE
The Date range filter instructs the report to return only those transactions that were entered into ADP Payments
during the selected date range for the All Transactions and Web Payment Form Transactions reports. For the
Settled Transactions report, the filter is for the date the transaction was settled.   For the Recurring Payments with
Expiring Credit Cards report, the filter is for the next payment date.
NOTE: The Recurring Payments with Expiring Credit Cards report is the only one for which the date range is for the
FUTURE (i.e. the next 15 days), rather than the past (i.e. the last 15 days).
You can select one of the pre‐configured filters listed below, or enter your own custom date range for the filter.
• 12 months‐‐ Payments entered over the past 360 days.
• Last 6 months‐‐ Payments entered over the past 180 days.

You can view, edit, subscribe, export, or delete the cloned report without affecting the original standard report.
ADDING STANDARD REPORTS QUICK LINKS
Standard reports are included in the Reports Quick Links section in side navigation by default. If you remove one of
them, it can be added back by following the steps below. (For more information on Reports Quick Links see Reports
Quick Links above.)
1. Locate the report you want to add in either the standard reports table.
2. Click the Action button associated with the report, then click “Add Quick Link.”
3. You will now see the report restored to the Reports Quick Links list.

You cannot subscribe to standard reports. If you want a standard report emailed to you
on a regular schedule, clone the report, edit it to select the date range you want to use,
and then subscribe to it in the custom reports section.
See Editing Custom Reports and Subscribing to Custom Reports below for instructions
on how to do this.
Chapter 7: Reports : Custom Reports 369
Custom Reports
In the custom reports section you can create your own filters and set your own field displays to view and export
transaction data to meet your specific business needs. Reports can contain transaction data, customer data or both.
Additionally, custom fields you created for the Customer or Payment module can be included in custom reports. The
last portion of this section provides samples of the types of custom reports you can create in ADP Payments.
Any custom report can be exported as an Adobe Acrobat .pdf or Excel file.  You can also subscribe to a custom report
and have it emailed to you on a set schedule, in either .pdf or .xls (Excel) format.
The following sections provide detailed information about custom reporting functions.
CREATING CUSTOM REPORTS
You can create custom reports based on the transaction activity in your account. When creating a report you can
configure the following report elements:
• Fields to include‐‐ Transaction fields, Customer fields, or both. You add individual fields to the report
as required. (See Transaction Fields Available for Custom Reports and Customer Fields Available for
Custom Reports below for detailed descriptions of available fields.)
• Transaction Date Range ‐‐ Select a date range, and whether the range is for transaction Enter Date or
Settle Date.
• Transaction Type ‐‐ Credit Card transactions, Echeck (ACH) transactions, or both.
• Transaction Status‐‐ See status definitions below.
Follow the steps below to create a new custom report:
You can create custom reports that contain only customer data and no transaction
data. However, only customers that have made at least one payment in the selected
date range will be included in the report.
Currently it is not possible to include customers with no payment activity in custom
reports. If you want a report that contains all of your customers, regardless of payment
activity, you can export your customer list as a .csv file. (See Exporting the Customer
List in Chapter 6 for how to do this.)
It is also not possible to create a report with one data row for each customer, since
each data row represents a payment‐‐ which is why the Transaction ID is a required
field for all reports.  (You may coincidentally end up with a report like this if each
customer has made only one payment in the date range.)  If you want to remove
duplicates, export the file, then sort by Customer ID, and delete any duplicate rows.
Chapter 7: Reports : Custom Reports 370
1. Click the “add new custom report” button located directly above the standard reports table on the Reports
dashboard.
2. The New Custom Report screen opens, as shown:
3. Enter a name for the report in the Report Name field. This is the name that will appear in the custom
reports table.
4. In the Include in Report section, check the Transactions checkbox to include transaction fields, and/or
check the Customers checkbox to include customer fields. As each box is checked, fields appear in the
bottom‐left Select Fields section.
NOTE: You must select at least one of these checkboxes to create a custom report.
5. In the Date Range section, select the date range you want to use.  The default selection is “12 months”
which reports on all activity in your account for the most recent 365 days. (The dates covered are shown in
the Start date and End date fields.) If you want to change the date range, follow the steps below.
Chapter 7: Reports : Custom Reports 371
  a. First,select whether you want to base your report on transaction Enter date or transaction Settle date,
and select that option in the Report on drop‐down box. Enter date is the default.
  b. Click the down‐arrow for the Date Range filter.
  c. The date filter will appear as shown below:
  d. Select the date range:
  i. Click “all” to display all transactions in your system. When you do this the From and To fields in the
Custom Date Range section will be blank, and the Start date and End date fields will be hidden, as
shown below:
  ii. To use a rolling date range, click the linked range definition. For example, to view payments
entered within the last 15 days, click the “15 days” link. The filter screen will close and you’ll see
the range you selected in the drop‐down box, and the current set of dates that matches the filter
in the Start date and End date fields. Each time you run the report it will be filtered based on the
rolling range you selected.
For example, in the screen capture below it is January 25, 2011 and “15 Days” is the selected
rolling date range, so the report Start date is 1/10/2011 and the report End date is 1/25/2011. If
you view or edit the report two days later on January 27, 2011 the Start date would be 1/12/2011
and the report End date would be 1/27/2011.

NOTE: The report will always run using these exact dates. However, you can use the Date Range filter
while viewing the report to temporarily change the dates included in the report view. (See Filtering
Custom Reports by Date below.) If you do this, the next time you view the report it will revert to the
programmed date range. You need to edit the report in order to permanently change the Date Range.
6. In the Payment Options section, select the Type of transactions you want to include in the report. You can
select both boxes, but you must select at least one.
• Check the Credit card box to include all credit card transactions for American Express, Discover,
MasterCard and Visa.

7. Check the Status checkbox for each transaction status you want to include in the report. You can select as
many as you like, but you must select at least one. Selecting all of the status checkboxes will result in
returning all transactions for the date range filter, as will selecting only the “All” box. The following
transaction status filters are available:
• All: All transactions in your account, regardless of status.
• Authorized: Credit card payments that have been authorized, but not yet submitted for
processing.
Chapter 7: Reports : Custom Reports 373
• Pending: The initial stage for every transaction sent for authorization. The system assigns this
status while waiting for an authorization response. In some rare cases, if communication is
disrupted before the system gets a response, the transaction will remain in the “Pending” status.
NOTE: If you see a credit card transaction with a status of “Pending” you can be assured that it
failed and was not submitted for processing. For ACH transactions, wait until the Expected Settle
Date to see if the transaction has settled or returned. If not, contact ADP Payments Customer Care
so that we can determine the actual status for the transaction.
• Posted: Credit Card and ACH payments that have been entered in the system, but not yet settled.
ACH credits that have been entered in the system, but not yet settled.
• Settled: Successful payments for which you have received funds. Successful credits for which your
account has been debited.
• Failed: Attempted payments that were never authorized or credits that could not be processed.
• Refunded: A transaction that has been reversed (refunded). When you issue a refund for a settled
transaction, the status of that transaction changes to “Refunded.”
• Voided‐‐ Any payment that was voided prior to it being submitted for processing.
• Refund (Posted): The credit transaction generated (but not yet submitted in a settlement batch)
when a settled transaction is refunded or when you process a standalone refund.
• Refund (Settled): A settled refund transaction. When funds have been deducted from your
account for a “Refund (Posted)” payment, the status changes to “Refund (Settled).”
• Returned: ACH payments that were unsuccessful for reasons other than NSF or chargeback. The
Reason Description field on the Transaction Details screen will display a return code for this
payment, and there will be an entry in the Return Date field for the date the return was
recorded.(See Appendix B: ACH Return Codes for more information on ACH Returns.)
• Returned NSF: An ACH transaction that failed because your customer had insufficient funds in the
account to cover the payment. The Reason Description field on the Transaction Detailsscreen will
display an R01 return code for this payment, and there will be an entry in the Return Date field for
the date the return was recorded.
NOTE: You can manually re‐process this payment again to attempt to collect.
• Chargeback‐‐ A payment being disputed by your customer.

Chapter 7: Reports : Custom Reports 378
VIEWING CUSTOM REPORTS
To view a custom report, click its linked Report name in the custom reports table on the Reports dashboard.
The report will open, and look similar to the sample custom report below:
The Date range filter appears above the table, and you can use it to change the dates included in the report. (See
Filtering Custom Reports by Date below for details)
The Payment Methods filter appears above the table and you can use it to change the payment types included in
the report. However, it cannot be used to include payment types not included in the original report configuration.
For example, if you created a custom report and checked only the “Credit card” box in the Payment Options Type
section, you cannot use the Payment Methods filter to add ACH payments to the report. However, you can use the
filter to display only American Express transactions. (See Filtering Custom Reports By Payment Method below.)
A SNAPSHOT of activity always appears above the table. The SNAPSHOT covers only the filtered data in the table
report. Thus, the values in the SNAPSHOT will change as you change the date range and payment methods filters for
the report.
Chapter 7: Reports : Custom Reports 379
NOTE: You will always see the snapshot with values for each status, regardless of whether you include transaction
fields in the report itself.
This snapshot provides a total number and dollar amount for the following payment statuses:
• Settled Transactions‐‐ Successful payments with a status of “settled” for which you have received
funds in your bank account.
NOTE: Funds may not appear in your bank account until several days after ADP Payments records them
as settled. This is a reporting issue related to your bank.
• Unsettled transactions‐‐ Payments that have been successfully submitted for processing, but have not
yet settled. You have not yet received funds in your bank account for these transactions. Transactions
with a status of “Authorized” and “Posted” are included in this sum.
NOTE: It is possible that your customers will see the funds debited from their accounts for these
transactions, even though you have not yet received the funds.
• Unsuccessful transactions‐‐ Payments that were not successfully processed, were disputed by your
customers, or payments that you voided. Transactions with a status of “Voided,” “Returned,”
“Returned NSF,” “Chargeback,” and “Failed” are included in this sum.
The table displays 10 rows at a time. If all of your field columns don’t fit in the screen, use the left‐right scroll bar at
the bottom of the table to scroll through the results. Click the linked page numbers at the bottom of the table to
navigate through the table results.
You can click any of the column headers to re‐sort the table results based on that column. Click once to sort from
high‐to‐low, and click again to sort from low‐to high. You may need to scroll right in order to find the column by
which you want to sort.
NOTE: Not all fields will be sortable. Export to Excel to sort by any field.
You will always know which column is being used to sort the table, and whether the
sort is high‐to‐low or low‐to‐high by looking for the arrow indicators next to the
column headers, as shown below:
Chapter 7: Reports : Custom Reports 380
You can click on any linked Customer ID in a custom report to open the Customer Record in view mode. (See
Viewing Customer Records in Chapter 6.)
NOTE: When you click the linked Customer ID from any report, a “back to report” link at the bottom of the customer
details screen will take you back to the report you were viewing prior to opening the screen.
You can click on any linked Transaction ID included in a custom report to open the Transaction Details page for the
payment. (See Viewing Transaction Details in Chapter 4.)
NOTE: When you click the linked Transaction ID from any report, a “back to report” link at the bottom of the
Transaction Details screen will take you back to the report you were viewing prior to opening the screen.
You can also export the report in both Excel and Adobe Acrobat .pdf format by clicking the “pdf” or “xls” links in the
Export to section at the top of the screen. (See Exporting Custom Reports below.)
FILTERING CUSTOM REPORTS BY DATE
The Date range filter on the view custom report screen controls the transactions displayed in the report table, based
on the dates selected.   It is dependant on the original custom report programming for the Report on field. If you
programmed the report to use Enter date in the Report on field the date filter will apply to transaction enter date; if
you selected “Settle Date” in the Report on field, the date filter will apply to transaction settle date. (See Creating
Custom Reports above for details on reporting filters.)
You can select one of the pre‐configured filters listed below, or enter your own custom date range for the filter.
• 12 months‐‐ Payments entered over the past 360 days.
• Last 6 months‐‐ Payments entered over the past 180 days.
• Last 90 days‐‐ Payments entered over the past 90 days.
• Last 30 days‐‐ Payments entered over the past 30 days.
• Last 15 days‐‐ Payments entered over the past 15 days.
• Today‐‐ Payments entered on the current calendar day.
• Yesterday‐‐ Payments entered on the previous calendar day.
Changes made to the Date range filter on this screen do not affect the custom report
configuration. Each time you open the custom report it will default to the TO and FROM
rolling date range or individually programmed custom dates saved with the original
report.

  iv. Click the day on which you want to end the filter, or type a date in the field.
  v. Click the “GO” button.
4. The drop‐down box will close, and the table will be filtered based on the date range you selected.
When selecting the From and To dates, you can navigate months using the forward and
back arrows in the calendar.  Or click the month, year heading at the top of the
calendar, to change to a full year view.  
Advance years by using the left and right arrows, and then click on the month to open
the calendar page to select a specific day.
Chapter 7: Reports : Custom Reports 382
FILTERING CUSTOM REPORTS BY PAYMENT METHOD
The Payment Methods filter instructs the report to return only those transactions of the payment type specified.
You can use it to refine the payment types included in the report. However, it cannot be used to include payment
types not included in the original report configuration. For example, if you created a custom report and checked only
the “Credit card” box in the Payment Options Type section, you cannot use the Payment Methods filter to add ACH
payments to the report. However, you can use the filter to display only American Express transactions.
You can select one or more of the following filter options:
• All‐‐ All Transactions, regardless of type.
• ACH‐‐ All ACH payments, regardless of ACH Type (PPD, CCD, TEL, WEB)
NOTE: You cannot currently filer reports based on individual ACH Types.
• American Express‐‐ All American Express transactions. (These will be displayed as “MOTO‐Amex” in
the Transaction Type field.)
• Discover‐‐ All Discover transactions. (These will be displayed as “MOTO‐Discover” in the Transaction
Type field.)
• MasterCard‐‐ All MasterCard transactions. (These will be displayed as “MOTO‐Master” in the
Transaction Type field.)
• Visa‐‐ All Visa transactions. (These will be displayed as “MOTO‐Visa” in the Transaction Type field.)
To create an entry date filter, follow the steps below:
1. Click the down‐arrow for the Payment Methods field.
2. The Payment Methods filter will appear as shown below:

SUBSCRIBING TO CUSTOM REPORTS
You can have any custom report emailed to you on a set schedule by subscribing to it. If you want to stop receiving
the report emails, you can unsubscribe to the report.

than one person, it is a good idea to create a group email address for use with the report subscription.
The email you receive will be generated based on the current report filter settings. Thus, if you edit a report, the
next scheduled email of that report will reflect the edited settings.
You cannot edit a subscription once it has been entered. If you need to make a change to a subscription, first
unsubscribe to it, and then subscribe to it again using the new settings.
If a report is deleted, all subscriptions to the report are automatically cancelled.
The following sections provide detailed instructions for subscribing to and unsubscribing from custom report emails.

colleagues before deleting a report that you did not create.
Chapter 7: Reports : Sample Custom Reports 397
Sample Custom Reports
The following are some sample configurations for custom reports that you may find useful for understanding your
transaction activity in ADP Payments.
You can create custom reports that contain only customer data and no transaction
data, other than the Transaction ID which is included in all reports.  However, only
customers that have made at least one payment in the selected date range will be
included in the report.
Currently it is not possible to include customers with no payment activity in custom
reports. If you want a report that contains all of your customers, regardless of payment
activity, you can export your customer list as a .csv file. (See Exporting the Customer
List in Chapter 6 for how to do this.)
It is also not possible to create a report with one data row for each customer, since
each data row represents a payment.  (You may coincidentally end up with a report like
this, if each customer has made only one payment in the date range.)  If you want to
remove duplicates, export the file to Excel then sort by Customer ID and delete any
duplicate rows.

RETURNED ECHECK (ACH) TRANSACTION REPORT
Use this report to create a list of all of the Echeck (ACH) transactions in your ADP Payments account that were
Returned due to an error with the transactions. ACH Returns are transactions that were initially authorized, but later
returned by the bank as un‐processable.
NOTE: This report only includes ACH Returns with a status of “Returned,” it does not include those with a status of
“Returned NSF” or with a Status of “Chargeback.”
When you include the “Reason Description” field in your reports, you will be able to see why an ACH transaction was
returned. The most common reason is “R03 No Account/Unable to locate account” which means that the account
number was likely entered incorrectly.   (See Appendix B: ACH Return Codes for a complete list of all return codes,
their definition, and a suggestion for what you should do next.)
To create a returned ACH transaction report,
follow the steps for Creating Custom Reports
described above, and use the following filters:
• Check both the Transactions and
the Customers checkboxes in the
Include in Report section.
• Set the Date Range filters to “all,”
select a rolling date range, or enter
a custom Start date and End date.
Then set Report on to “Enter date.”
• In the Payment Options section,
check only the E‐Check box in the
Type section.
• In the Payment Options section,
check only Returned in the Status
section.
• Suggested fields to add:
• Transaction.Transaction ID
• Transaction.Status
• Transaction.Reason Description
• Transaction.Transaction Date

CHARGEBACK REPORT
Use this report to create a list of all of the ACH chargebacks in your account.
For an ACH transaction, it is considered to be a chargeback if the transaction was not properly authorized, or if your
customer tells the bank that the transaction was not authorized. When you include the “Reason Description” field in
your reports, you will be able to see why an ACH transaction is a chargeback. The most common reason is “R10
Customer Claims Not Authorized,” which means that the customer told the bank that you were not authorized to
process the transaction. When this happens, your ACH processor debits your account for the amount of the
transaction if you have already received funds for it. You will also be assessed an ACH chargeback fee by ADP
Payments. (See Appendix B: ACH Chargeback Return Codes for a complete list of all chargeback return codes, their
definitions, and a suggestion for what you should do next.)
To create a chargeback transaction report, follow
the steps for Creating Custom Reports described
above, and use the following filters:
• Check both the Transactions and the
Customers checkboxes in the
Include in Report section.
• Set the Date Range filtersto a preset
range, or enter a custom Start date
and End date.
• In the Payment Options Type
section, check the E‐Check box.
• In the Payment Options Status
section, check only Chargeback.
• Suggested fields to add:
• Transaction.Transaction ID

particularly helpful in locating duplicate transactions entered online by your customers, locating transactions
generated by duplicate payment schedules, and identifying transactions processed by any individual user.
To create a transaction troubleshooting report, follow the steps for Creating Custom Reports described above, and
use the following filters:
• Check both the Transactions and the
Customers checkboxes in the Include

This is the Payment # field displayed in the table on the manage recurring payments screen.
• Transaction.User ID
NOTE: In most cases, this is the User ID for the ADP Payments user who entered the payment. For payments
entered on web payment forms, this will be the User ID attached to the payment form. For payments entered
via Customer Portal, this will be the Master Administrator User’s User ID.
• Transaction.Payment Type
• Transaction.Status
• Transaction.Reason Description
NOTE: If the transaction has failed or is an ACH return or is a chargeback, this field will provide information
on the problem.

INVOICE SETTINGS
This section enables you to create settings that control whether you will accept partial payments for invoices, and
whether your customers will be required to login to pay invoices. Global Terms and Conditions of Sale are entered
in this section as well.
To Enter Invoice Settings:
Answer the questions in this section to establish functional settings for how your customers can pay your invoices.
1. You have the option to accept partial payments on invoices.
  a. Select the “Yes, allow partial payments” radio button to enable partial payments of invoices.
  b. Select the “No” radio button if you will only accept payment in full.
2. When your customers click a “Pay Now” button to pay an invoice online, you can allow them to directly
access the invoice payment page, or require them to login. When customers login, they can pay using
securely stored bank accounts and credit cards and can view a history of invoices and payments. (See
Appendix E: Customer Portal for details on how customers can access your ADP Payments Customer Portal.)
  a. Select the “Yes, require customers to login” radio button if you want to require a login.
  b. Select the “No” radio button to enable invoice payment with or without a login.
NOTE: It is strongly suggested that you require a log‐in for all invoice payments, as this will make
reporting significantly easier. If you do not, a new Customer Record will be created when the invoice is
paid. The invoice will be marked as paid in your ADP Payments system, but the payment will be
attached to the new Customer Record and the invoice itself will be attached to the original Customer
Record.
To Enter Terms of Sale:
Use this section, shown below, to enter or edit the Terms of Sale that will appear on all your invoices. Your system is
configured with generic terms of sale that meet all ACH and credit card processing requirements. You should review
these terms of sale and customize them for your business. You can enter as much text as you like in this field, so
make your Terms of Sale as comprehensive as necessary.
NOTE: These Terms of Sale will appear on the online invoice form used to collect a payment from your customers. It
is important that they meet all requirements for online Credit Card and Echeck (ACH) payments. (See Appendix A:
Authorizing Transactions for more information on required language.)
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 411
TERMS & TAXES
Use this section to create the Payment Terms and Taxes that will be used in your ADP Payments invoices. Creating
these settings is optional. You can create entries for one or both sections, or leave them blank. When you configure
Payment Terms and Taxes in advance, you can easily select them when creating new invoices.   (See Chapter 5:
Invoices for more information on creating invoices.)
The following sections provide detailed instructions for creating Payment Terms and Taxes.
NOTE: Be certain to click the “save” button at the bottom of the screen to save any additions or changes you make to
the Payment Terms and/or Taxes tables. Your work will not be saved unless the “save” button is clicked.
Payment Terms
Follow the steps below to create new Payment Terms. Once created, these Payment Terms will be included in the
Payment terms drop‐down box on the send new invoice screen, as shown below. (See Chapter 5: Invoices for more
information on creating invoices.)
NOTE: You can use the “create new term” link in the Payment terms drop‐down box on the send new invoice screen
to create a new Payment Term directly from that screen. However, you cannot edit or delete Payment Terms from
the list. In order to edit or delete a Payment Term, you must use the Terms and Taxes section in the configuration
tab.
Follow the steps below to create new Payment Terms:
1. Click the “add another payment term” link in the PAYMENT TERMS section.
You can create Payment Terms and Tax Rates from the send new invoice screen. (See
Enter new Payment terms. in Chapter 5.) However, you can only edit and delete
Payment Terms and Tax Rates from the Settings‐‐> Configuration section.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 412
2. You will now see a new row in the PAYMENT TERMS table. Enter a description of this Payment Term in the
first field. This description will not be displayed on invoices or payment forms.
3. In the Payment due drop‐down box, select the payment terms.    
• You can choose one of the pre‐programmed values: “On receipt,” “In 15 days,”
“In 30 days,” or “In 60 days.”
• To enter a custom value, select the last radio button and enter the custom
number of days in the field, as shown on the screen capture to the right.
4. Repeat steps 1‐3 to add additional Payment Terms.
5. Click the “save” button at the bottom of the page to save your Payment Terms and return to the
Configuration Dashboard.
NOTE: You must click the “save” button to save your entries. However, you can complete the Taxes section
first, and then click “save” to save your entries in both sections at once.
To edit a Payment Term Description, place your cursor in the field and make any necessary text changes.
To edit the Payment due term attached to any Payment Term, click the Payment due drop‐down box and select a
new term or enter a custom one.
To delete a Payment Term, click its “‐remove” link in the far right column of the table.
NOTE: You will not be prompted to confirm the removal of a Payment Term. However, if you delete one by mistake,
simply enter it again as a new Payment Term.
Be certain to click the “save” button at the bottom of the screen to save all new Payment Terms entered, as well as
any changes or deletes of existing Payment Terms.
Editing or removing a Payment Term will not affect any invoices or invoice schedules
already created in ADP Payments. Payment Terms are used as shortcuts when creating
an invoice or invoice schedule. When the invoice orschedule issaved, the current value
for the Payment Term is saved with it, not a reference to the Payment Term Description.
For example, if I create an invoice schedule using a Payment Term called “Standard,”
which is defined as “In 15 days,” and then later edit the definition of “Standard” to be
defined as “In 30 days,” all invoices generated by the schedule will calculate the due
date based on 15 days, NOT 30 days.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 413
Tax Rates
Tax Rates created on this screen will be included in the Tax1 and Tax 2 drop‐down boxes on the send new invoice
screen, as shown below. (See Chapter 5: Invoices for more information on creating invoices.)
NOTE: You cannot edit or delete Tax Rates from the list. In order to edit or delete a Tax Rate, you must use the Terms
and Taxessection in the configuration tab. You can add new taxesfrom the send new invoice screen, however doing
this will cause your entire invoice to be cleared‐‐ so you should only use this function from a blank invoice screen.
Follow the steps below to create new Tax Rates:
1. Click the “add another tax rate” link in the TAX RATES section, shown above.
2. There will now be a new row in the TAX RATES table.   Enter a Tax Name in the first field. The Tax Name you
enter will be displayed as an item on your invoice or payment form.
3. In the Tax Rate field, enter a value for the tax. For example:
• To add a 4% tax, you would enter “4.00” in the field, and leave the drop‐down box with the “%”
selected.
• To add a $5 flat tax, you would enter “5.00” in the field, and select the “$” from the drop‐down box.
4. Repeat steps 1‐3 to add additional Tax Rates.
5. Click the “save” button at the bottom of the page to save your Tax Rates and return to the Configuration
Dashboard.
NOTE: You must click the “save” button to save your entries. However, you can complete the Payment
Terms section first, and then click “save” to save your entries in both sections at once.
To edit a Tax Name, place your cursor in the field and make any necessary text changes.
To edit the Tax Rate, place your cursor in the field to change the amount, or change the selection in the%/$ drop‐
down box.
To delete a Tax Rate, click its “‐remove” link in the far right column of the table.
NOTE: You will not be prompted to confirm the removal of a Tax Rate. However, if you delete one by mistake simply
enter it again as a new Tax Rate.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 414
Be certain to click the “save” button at the bottom of the screen to save all new Tax Rates entered, as well as any
changes or deletes of existing Tax Rates.
ITEMS
Use this section to create and manage the goods and services you use in your ADP Payments invoices. You can create
items in advance from this screen, or your can add them as needed when creating new invoices on the send new
invoice screen. When you do add items on the send new invoice screen (see Adding Items Individually in Chapter 5)
or via an item import (see Importing Item Batches in Chapter 5), they will be accessible from the List Item
Management configuration screen.   
Click the “Items” link on the Settings‐‐> Configuration screen to access the List Item Management screen, shown
below. This is the same screen you see when you click the “manage list items” link on the send new invoice screen.
Editing or removing a Tax Rate will not affect any invoices or invoice schedules already
created in ADP Payments. Tax Rates are used as shortcuts when creating an invoice or invoice
schedule. When the invoice or schedule is saved, the current value for the Tax Rate is saved
with it, not a reference to the Tax Name.
For example, if I create an invoice schedule using a Tax Rate called “CO State Tax,” which is
defined as 4.00%, and then later edit the definition of “CO State Tax” to be defined as 4.50%,
all invoices generated by the schedule will calculate tax at 4.00% NOT 4.50%.
If you want to update the Tax Rate for an invoice schedule, you will need to edit the schedule.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 415
The List Item Management screen displays your items 10 at a time. Use the page number links at the bottom of the
table to page through your results. The table contains the item Name, the Description, and the unit Price. Click the

PREFERENCES
This section enables you to create settings that control how your ADP Payments invoices look (logo and contact
information). The settings entered here are also used to co‐brand your Customer Portal‐‐the interface your
customers use when they login to make payments and view invoice and payment history. (See Appendix E: Customer
Portal.)
NOTE: These settings do not control Web Payment Pages, which are configured in the Web payment pages tab in
the Settings section. (See Web Payment Pages.)
You can add your logo, manage the contact information for your company, and set a global message that appears on
all invoices.
The following sections provide instructions for configuring each section of the Pick Your Preferences screen.
Editing or deleting a List Item will not affect any previously created one‐time invoices
or invoice schedules. One‐time invoices will always reflect the item names,
descriptions, and prices used when they were created. Recurring invoices generated as
part of invoice schedules will always be created using the item names, descriptions,
and prices used when they were created.
If you have raised prices or changed the descriptions of items, and you want those
reflected on upcoming scheduled invoices, you need to edit the original schedule.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 417
Upload Logo
You can upload your company logo into ADP Payments, and it will appear on all invoices you create and send via ADP
Payments. Your logo will also appear on the login page your customers use to pay invoices online, and on the login
page for your Customer Portal. (See Appendix E: Customer Portal.) This is not a required step, but uploading a logo
will help reinforce your brand on invoices.
Follow these steps to upload a logo:
1. In the Upload your company logo section of the Pick Your Preferences screen, click the “Choose File”
button to locate your logo on your hard drive and select it.
NOTE: The file must be no more 150KB in size, and in JPG, GIF or PNG format. The system will resize the
logo to fit the allotted space on the invoice.
2. Click the “upload” button to upload the logo image to ADP Payments. When your logo is successfully
uploaded you will see the file name next to the button, as shown below:
3. Click the “save” button at the bottom of the screen.
NOTE: This is an important, but easy to forget step. If you do not click the “save” button the new logo will
not be saved even though it appears to have uploaded correctly in the logo section.
NOTE: If you want to change the logo, follow the steps for adding a logo outlined above. The new logo will overwrite
the old one.
The best place to see how your logo looks is on the invoice preview screen. (To do this, create a new invoice and
click the “preview” link at the bottom of the screen. See Preview the Invoice in Chapter 5 for detailed instructions.)
Your logo will be included at the top of the invoice, as shown below.:
If you want to remove the logo from your invoices and login pages, you can delete it by following the steps below:
1. On the Pick Your Preferences screen, click the “Delete” link next to the logo file name.
2. Click “yes” in the delete confirmation pop‐up box to delete the logo, or “cancel” to keep the logo.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 418
3. Another pop‐up box will appear to confirm the delete. Click “ok” to return to the Pick Your Preferences
screen.
4. The file name for the logo will no longer appear under the “upload” button.
5. Click the “save” button at the bottom of the screen to save the change. You will no longer see the logo on
your invoices.
NOTE: This is an important, but easy to forget step. If you do not click the “save” button the logo will not be
removed even though it appears to have been successfully deleted in the logo section.
6. You can upload a new logo at any time.
Invoice Preferences
The Invoice Preferences section is used to enable and configure auto‐numbering of invoices in your ADP Payments
system. The Next Invoice number field will always display the invoice number that will be assigned to your next
invoice. For example, if the Next Invoice number field is “00005” and one new invoice is sent, when you return to
the screen, the Next Invoice number field will be “00006.”
The default configuration is to begin invoice numbering at “00001” and increment from there. You can change this
field at any time to synchronize it with your non‐ADP Payments invoicing. You can enter any number between 00001
and 999999999. The system displays 5 digits of the invoice number by default, and will increase to 12 digits as
necessary.
NOTE: 999999999 is the highest invoice number available. The system will return to “00001” after invoice#
“999999999” is sent.
If you want to disable auto‐invoice numbering, enter “00000” in the Next Invoice number field.
You will always have the option to edit an auto‐generated invoice number on one‐time
invoices. If you do this, for example if you change an automated invoice number of
“00999” to “00999A” the system will use the original automated number on your next
invoice.
If you do not want to use auto‐numbering for invoices, enter “00000” in the Next
invoice number field. If you do this, you will always have to manually enter an invoice
number for one‐time invoices.
If you disable auto‐numbering, the system will assign an invoice number using the
format of “RECURS‐‐Schedule ID‐‐System Invoice ID.” for all recurring invoices.

EMAIL PREFERENCES AND TEMPLATES
The ADP Payments system uses a number of email templates that are sent to your customers on your behalf. When
your account is created, a full set of email templates with default content is configured for your account. Merge
fields are used to personalize these emails for your business. (See Appendix D: Email Templates for a full list of email
templates along with a description of how they are used and a complete list of available merge fields.)
Note: You may not see all of the email categories described in this manual in your system. You will only see email
categories that apply to the type of payments configured for your system.
You can edit the default set of email templatesfrom the Email Preferences and Templatesscreen, accessed from the
Settings‐‐> Configuration screen.    
You can also configure default settings for how payment and recurring payment pre‐notification emails, receipts,
and failure notification emails are sent.   
The following sections provide detailed information on working with email templates and setting email preferences.
Setting Email Preferences
When you configure global email preferences they are used as the default settings for all payments, recurring
payments, and invoices sent from your ADP Payments system. The settings you configure on this screen will be used
for all payments entered online via Customer Portal or via Web Payment pages, as well as for all payments and
recurring payments imported via batches.
Global email preferences will be the default settings for receipts, failure notifications, and schedule pre‐notification
emails when you enter new payments and schedules directly from ADP Payments. You will be able to make changes
to individual payments and schedules on the collect new payment screen.
Follow the steps below to configure your email preferences:
1. Click the “email preferences and templates” link on the Settings‐‐>Configuration screen.
2. The Select Email Options And Edit Templates screen opens.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 422
3. In the top PAYMENT FAILURE NOTIFICATIONS section set the default Failure Notification settings for the
collect new payment screen. You will be able to make adjustments on a case by case basis when entering
new payments.
  a. Check the “Send notification to the customer” box if you want to send failure notifications by default.
When you check this box, any failure notifications will automatically be sent to the main email address
attached to the Customer Record. Leave the box unchecked if you don't want to send customer failure
notifications.
NOTE: The email address will always be displayed on the collect new payment screen so you’ll always
know the exact address to which the failure notifications will be emailed.
  b. Check the “Send notification to my company at:” box if you want to send the failure notification to a
different email address, and enter the email address(es) you want to use in the field.   You can enter
any email address you like in this field, and can enter multiple email addresses separated by commas.
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a failure notification to the customer, the email address(es)
entered in this field will be the email CC addresses. If the “Send notification to the customer” box is not
checked, then email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 423
4. Use the TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section to set the default receipt settings for the collect new payment
screen. You will be able to make adjustments on a case by case basis when entering new payments.
  a. Check the “Send notification to the customer” box if you want to send payment receipts by default.
When you check this box, a receipt will automatically be sent to the main email address attached to
the Customer Record. Leave the box unchecked if you don't want to send customer receipts.
NOTE: The email address will always be displayed on the collect new payment screen so you’ll always
know the exact address to which the receipt will be emailed.
NOTE: If you want to send receipts for online payments and for imported payment batches you must
check this box.
  b. Check the “Send notification to my company at:” box if you want to send the payment receipt to a
different email address, and enter the email address(es) you want to use in the field.   You can enter
any email address you like in this field, and can enter multiple email addresses separated by commas.
NOTE: If you have also elected to send a receipt to the customer, the email address(es) entered in this
field will be the email CC addresses. If the “Send notification to the customer” box is not checked, then
email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 424
5. Use the RECURRING PAYMENT REMINDERS section to configure email notification settings for recurring
payment schedules.
  a. You have the option to automatically send a notification to a customer prior to a payment that is part
of a recurring payment schedule. This email is always sent to the main email address attached to the
Customer Record.
  i. To send the email, select the “Yes” radio button for the “Do you want to remind customers of an
upcoming scheduled payment?” question. Select the “No” radio button if you don’t want to send
the reminder email.
NOTE: The setting you configure here will be the default setting on the collect new payment
screen. You can make changes to each individual schedule when it is created without affecting this
global setting.
  ii. From the Customize email timing drop‐down box, select the number of days prior to the payment
date you want to send the notice. You can select between 1 and 10 days.
  b. You have the option to send email notifications when new schedules are created and when they are
edited. (The changed schedule email is only sent for a material change of the Amount, Frequency, Start
Date, End Date, or Payment Account.) Customize these settings in the “Do you want to send emails for
new and updated recurring payment schedules?” section.
The settings you configure here will be used for all recurring payment schedules. You cannot make
changes to individual schedules for these settings.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 425
  i. Check the “Send notification to the customer” box if you want to send new schedule and schedule
change emails to the main email address attached to the Customer Record.
  ii. Check the “Send notification to my company at:” box if you want to send the new schedule and
schedule change emails to a different email address, and enter the email address(es) you want to
use in the field.   You can enter any email address you like in thisfield, and can enter multiple email
addresses separated by commas.
NOTE: If you have also elected to send to the customer, the email address(es) entered in this field
will be the email CC addresses. If the “Send notification to the customer” box is not checked, then
email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
  c. You have the option to send an email to your customer when the credit card attached to one of their
active recurring payment schedules is about to expire. This email goes out on the first of the month in
which the card expires. (For example, if the credit card has an expiration date of May, 2011 this email
will be sent on May 1, 2011.)
  i. Check the “Send notification to the customer” box if you want to send credit card expiration
emails to the main email address attached to the Customer Record.
  ii. Check the “Send notification to my company at:” box if you want to send the credit card expiration
emails to a different email address, and enter the email address(es) you want to use in the field.   
You can enter any email address you like in this field, and can enter multiple email addresses
separated by commas.
NOTE: If you have also elected to send to the customer, the email address(es) entered in this field
will be the email CC addresses. If the “Send notification to the customer” box is not checked, then
email addresses in this box will be placed in the email To field.
6. Use the INVOICES section to configure the system to copy your company on all invoice emails sent by the
system and to edit the invoice email sent for all invoices that are not past due.   
The default system setting is to send both the new schedule email and the schedule
change email.
Credit card and ACH processing rules require that these emails be sent for every new
schedule entered and when any material change is made to a schedule. Failure to send
these notificationsis very likely to result in chargebacks, and possibly the suspension of
your processing rights.
You are provided with the option to turn these emails off‐‐ however if you choose to do
so make certain that you are providing confirmation of new schedules and schedule
changes to your customers in some other way (i.e. fax or regular mail).

setting.)
NOTE: You can always check the “Send me a copy” box on the Send invoice by email and Recurring
Invoice Email screens to receive a copy of any individual invoice. This copy will always be sent to the
“Primary account contact” email address.
7. Use the PAST DUE INVOICE FOLLOW‐UP section to configure the system to re‐send invoices that have not
been paid by their designated due date. The system will automatically re‐send the past due invoice one
time, based on the configuration setting entered here.
NOTE: You can manually re‐send the invoice at any time by selecting the “Resend invoice” link from the
Action menu in the Invoices table. (See Resending Invoices in Chapter 5 for how to do this.)
  a. To send the email, select the “Yes” radio button for the “Do you want to automatically re‐send an
Invoice if unpaid?” question. Select the “No” radio button if you don’t want to send the reminder
email.

Viewing and Editing Email Templates
ADP Payments sends a variety of email templates to your customers on your behalf. A full list of these templates can
be found in Appendix D: Email Templates. Some of these emails, such as the Customer Portal password reset email
are not accessible for viewing or editing. However, most of the email templates used in your ADP Payments system
can be viewed and edited so that you can customize them for your business needs.
The Select Email Options And Edit Templatesscreen, each section lists the email templates that are governed by the
configuration settings in that section. To view or edit the template, simply click the “edit” link to the right of the
template name.
The Edit Email Template screen opens and displays the email subject and body text, as shown below.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 428
Note that the body text contains merge fields for much of the pertinent information. These merge fields will be used
to customize the email based on details for individual accounts, settings, and customers.
You can make the following changes on this screen. (Be sure to click the “save changes” button at the bottom of the
screen to save your changes.)
• You can change the email Subject by editing or replacing the default text. Note that you can use merge
fields in the subject line.
NOTE: The default emails in your ADP Payments account use a merge field for your company name.
This is done to ensure that emails are customized for your business out of the box. You can replace the
merge field with static text if you like. For example, instead of “Thank You for Your Payment to
[[Client.Contact.CompanyName]]” you could edit the Subject line to “Thank You for Your Payment to
Example Company.”
• Edit the Email body to make any text changes you like. You can also add, remove, or change merge
fields. This is a text email, so you cannot include HTML elements such as bold or underlined text.
NOTE: The default emails loaded into your ADP Payments account use merge fields for your company
information to provide customized content for your business out of the box. You can replace the merge
fields with static text. For example, instead of keeping the merge fields in the email signature, you can
replace them with a static signature. Look for merge fields that begin with “Client.” to identify fields
that are merging information about your company.
• A subset of available merge fieldsis listed to the right of the Email body field. To place one of these
in your email, place your cursor at the insertion spot in the Email body field, then click the merge
field you want to insert.
A full list of available merge fields can be found in the Catalog of Email Merge Fields section of
Appendix D: Email Templates. To use these merge fields, copy the merge text from Appendix D
and paste it into the Email body.
• You can restore an edited email to its original content at any time by clicking the “restore default
template” link located to the right of the Email body field. (Orange highlight in above screen capture.)

SNAIL MAIL CREDITS
In addition to emailing invoices to your customers, and enabling them to view and pay invoices online via you
Customer Portal, ADP Payments enables you to create invoices and have them mailed via the U.S. Postal Service to
your customers.   When you use this option, the invoice is sent to your customer using the address provided (this
address is checked for errors prior to sending), and a return envelope addressed to your company is provided for
your customer to use when mailing a payment. (See New Invoices and Invoice Schedules in Chapter 5 for detailed
instructions on using the snail mail invoice option.)
NOTE: Even if you use snail mail to send invoices to your customers, they can still log in to your Customer Portal to
view and pay the invoice online.
For each invoice you send via “snail mail” you will be charged one invoice credit. Invoice credits must be purchased
in advance from the Snail Mail Credits screen in the configuration section. This screen is accessed from the “buy
snail mail credits” link in the ADDITIONAL OPTIONS section of the configuration screen, as shown below.
The Snail Mail Credits screen displays the number of credits you have at the top, along with the price per credit
applicable to your account. The bottom portion of the screen describes the snail mail invoice process. If you want to
purchase credits, enter the number you want in the field then click the “purchase” button.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 430
The Purchase Snail Mail Credits screen opens as shown below. The total number of credits you are purchasing,
along with the cost for those credits, is displayed under the page title. If this is not correct, click the “cancel” button
to return to the Snail Mail Credits screen without completing the purchase.
Snail mail credits must be purchased via credit card. If you already have a credit card on file, it will be available for
use. (Don’t forget to enter the card’s CVV2 code.). If you have more than one card on file, you can select the one you
want to use. If you do not have a credit card on file, or if you want to use a card not yet on file, use the fields under
the saved cards table to add it.
NOTE: Snail Mail credits are non‐refundable. You will not receive a refund for unused credits.
Click the “purchase credits” button to complete your purchase. You are returned to the Snail Mail Credits screen,
and the number of available credits is updated to reflect your purchase.
NOTE: If you are using the snail mail option for recurring invoices, be certain that you always have sufficient credits
in your account to cover automatically generated invoices. If there are not sufficient credits in your account when a
recurring snail mail invoice is created, the invoice will not be sent. (However, if you also select the e‐mail invoice
option it will be created, and you can purchase additional snail mail credits and use the resend function to manually
mail the invoice.)
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 431
CUSTOM FIELDS
You can add custom fields to the Customer module and to the Payment module of ADP Payments.
The custom fields screen is accessed by clicking the “custom fields” link in the ADDITIONAL OPTIONS section of the
Settings‐‐> configuration screen.
When you click this link the main Custom Fields screen opens, as shown below:
If you have custom fields configured, they will be listed in the Custom Fields table. (If no fields are defined, you will
not see the table.) The custom fields are listed in the table in alphabetical order by Name. The table contains the
following columns:
• Name‐‐ The Field name for your custom field. This is the text that identifies the field on your ADP
Payments customer and payment screens, and in your web payment pages. Click the linked column
header to sort by Field name. The default sort is A‐to‐Z. Click to sort from Z‐to‐A.
• Type‐‐ Indicates the type of custom field. ADP Payments supports 4 custom field types: Text, Text Area,
DropDown and CheckBox. The table is not sortable by this field.
NOTE: Before adding a custom field, you should determine the type of field you need and its
characteristics. For example, if you want to capture the shirt color your customer wants, you could add
a drop‐down box listing all of the colors from which to choose. If you want to record a yes/no answer,
such as whether to include the customer on your mailing list, a checkbox would be more appropriate.
• Module‐‐ Indicates the Field location‐‐Whether the field is attached to the Customer module or the
Payment module. This column can be sorted to group fields by Module. Click once to show Customer
fields first (they will be listed in alphabetical order within the Module field sort). Click again to show all
the Payment fields first.
• Default value‐‐ For text fields and text areas, you can define a default text string for use with the field.
If you have done this, you’ll see that text (or the first portion of it) displayed in this column. You cannot
define a Default value for CheckBox or DropDown fields.
NOTE: The default value for DropDown fields is “Select,” which is added automatically by the system.
NOTE: When you set a Default value for a custom field, all Customers or Payments (depending on the
module to which the field is attached) created from that point forward will be assigned the default field
value. The value will not be assigned to any Customer or Payment created prior to the field’s creation.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 432
Custom fields attached to the Customer module appear at the bottom of the left column in the top section of the
customers screen. (In the screen capture below, “Email Newsletter” and “Spouse Name” are custom fields.)    
Custom fields attached to the Payment module will appear at the bottom of the right hand column in the Enter
payment details portion of the collect new payment screen. (In the screen capture below, “Club Level” is a custom
field.)   
NOTE: The custom fields are only supported for one‐time payments. If you select the Payment type as “Recurring
billing” or “Payment plan” the fields will be hidden.
The following sections provide detailed instructions on adding, editing and deleting custom fields.
Any new custom field you define displays in the Customer Record or the transaction
details page for all existing customers and payments, as well as any new customers and
payments you enter into the system.
Deleting a custom field removes it from the system completely. Any data entered in the
field for previous transactions will be removed, and will not be accessible in reporting
or on the transaction details page.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 433
Adding New Custom Fields
Follow the steps below to add a new custom field to the Customer or Payment module.
1. From the configuration tab in the Settings section, click the “custom fields” link in the ADDITIONAL
OPTIONS section of the screen.
2. The Custom Fields screen opens.
3. If you have already defined custom fields, they will be displayed in a table. If you have yet to define any
fields, you will not see a table.
4. Click the “add a new custom field” link.
5. The Custom Field Details screen opens.
6. Enter a Field name. Do not enter a colon (:) after the name, the system will automatically add it for you.
(i.e., enter “Sample Field” not “Sample Field:”)
NOTE: This Field name will display on the ADP Payments screens you use to enter or edit customers and
payments, as well as on the Transaction Details screen and transaction details emails you send to
customers.
7. From the Field location drop‐down box, select “Customer” to add a custom field to the customer module,
or select “Payment” to add a custom field to the payment module.
8. In the Field type drop‐down box, select one of the options:
  a. Text‐‐ Creates a blank text field that you can use to enter up to 255 characters of text.
• You have the option to enter text in the Default value field.
NOTE: If you enter text here for a Customer field, it will be pre‐populated in the field for every
NEW customer in your system entered after the custom field is saved. If you enter text here for a
Payment field, it will be pre‐populated for all NEW one‐time payments entered after the custom
field is saved.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 434
  b. Text area‐‐Creates a blank text area that you can use to enter large amounts of text on multiple lines.
• You have the option to enter text in the Default value field.
NOTE: If you enter text here for a Customer field, it will be pre‐populated in the field for every
NEW customer in your system entered after the custom field is saved. If you enter text here for a
Payment field, it will be pre‐populated for all NEW one‐time payments entered after the custom
field is saved.
  c. CheckBox‐‐ Creates a checkbox that can be checked or unchecked. The default state for a checkbox is
always unchecked.
  d. DropDown‐‐Creates a list of items from which you can select. You can only select one item in a
DropDown field; ADP Payments does not support multiple selections. When you select this option, the
Drop Down List Items area appears, as shown below, for use in configuring the items in the drop‐down
box.
For each item you want to add:
  iii. Enter Display Text in the first field. This is the text that you want shown in the drop‐down box your
customers and users see.
  iv. Enter Value in the second field. This is the value that you want to appear in reports, on receipts,
and on the transaction details page. For example, if you use an internal inventory system to code
shirt size, you might want to use Display Text of “Extra Large” and a Value of “XL‐‐999G” so that
you can export a report of orders into the inventory system.
NOTE: In most cases it is a good idea to make the Display Text and the Value the same so your
customers recognize the value on the receipt they receive as the one they selected.
  v. Click the “add” button to create the new entry.
Chapter 8: Settings : System Configuration 435
  vi. You will now see the item you just created in a list above the add list item line.
  vii. Repeat steps i ‐ iii to add additional items to the drop‐down list.

4. From this screen you can:
• Edit the Field name.
NOTE: The new (changed) field name will be displayed on the customer and payment screens, and in
any transaction details pages you view or email‐‐ even for transactions processed prior to the change.
• Change the Field location. You can switch a field from the Customer module to the Payment module,
or from the Payment module to the Customer module.
NOTE: If you do this, any values stored in the field will not be transferred to the new module; they will
be treated as if you deleted the field. For example, if you had a Customer field for “Apartment #” and
changed that field to a Payment field, the value saved with the Customer Record would be deleted, and
you would need to enter it again on each new payment processed for the customer.
• Change the Field type. If you change the Field type to a DropDown from any other Field type, you will
need to define the drop‐down list items. (See above for instructions on how to do this.)
NOTE: Be very careful when changing the Field type, since it is possible to lose saved data when you do
this. For example, if you change the Field type from Text to CheckBox you will lose all previously saved
data in the field.
• Change or remove the Default value.
NOTE: If you change or remove the Default value, all previously saved customers and previously
processed payments will not inherit the new value.
5. When you’re finished making changes, click the “save changes” button to save your work. Or click the

changed. You will also receive an email confirming the change. The next time you login to ADP Payments
use the new password you just set.
You can change your password as often as you like. If you believe it has been compromised, be sure to re‐set it
immediately. It is also a good idea to re‐set your Security Question if you believe your password has been
compromised.
Each time your password is reset, regardless of method, an email will be sent to the
address on record for the User ID.
If you receive this email and you did not reset your password, please contact ADP
Payments Customer Care immediately at 800‐297‐5341, as it is possible that your
account has been compromised.

Users
The Users screen enables management of everyone who is permitted access to your ADP Payments system. It is
accessed by clicking the “Settings” link in top navigation, and then selecting the users tab.
When ADP Payments accounts are enabled, a Master Administrator User is created with an “Administrator” role.
That Master Administrator User can then create any number of additional users, and assign them to any number of
standard or custom roles. (See Roles below.) The Master Administrator User can never be deleted or deactivated,
and can never be changed from the “Administrator” role. (See About the Master Administrator below for details.)
The following sections provide detailed information about viewing, adding, editing, disabling, and deleting users.
ABOUT THE MASTER ADMINISTRATOR
The Master Administrator User is generated when your ADP Payments account is configured. This user can then add
additional users to the system and assign roles and processing limits. The Master Administrator is assigned the
“Administrator” role and cannot be edited by any other user. (Master Administrator Users can edit their own
records.) Thus, when it appears in the Users dashboard table, other users will not see the Edit button in the Action
column. (The Master Administrator User will see the Edit button, but will have only the “Edit” link not the “Delete”
link.)
The primary differences between the Master Administrator User and other Users are as follows:
• The Master Administrator User is created automatically by the system with the “Administrator” role,
which cannot be changed.
• The User ID created for the Master Administrator User is always that person’s email address.
NOTE: If you need to change the Master User ID, contact ADP Payments Customer Care.
• The Master Administrator’s Security Question is set during the Simple Sign‐up® process. It can be
changed at any time from the Settings‐‐>Configuration‐‐>Account Access screen.
• The Master Administrator User CANNOT be edited by any other user and cannot have a password reset
from the Users screen by any other user.
NOTE: Master Administrator Users can edit their own user information such as name, email address,
and phone number. They can also reset their own passwords using the “password reset” link in the
User Record. But as noted above, editing the role is not permitted.
• The Master Administrator User cannot be deleted or set to “Inactive.”
• If the Master Administrator User gets locked‐out (due to excessive failed logins), only ADP Payments
Customer Care can unlock the account. Call 800‐297‐5341 for assistance.
Chapter 8: Settings : Users 442
THE USERS DASHBOARD
When you click the users tab the Users dashboard table appears, as shown below (in Master Administrator View):
The table lists all of the users in your account, with 10 rows to a page. If you have more than 10 users, there will be
linked page numbers at the bottom of the table. Click the linked numbers at the bottom of the table to navigate
through the list.
The Users table contains the following columns:
• Last‐‐ The User’s last name. You can sort the table alphabetically by last name. Click the linked column
header once to sort from A‐to‐Z, click again to sort from Z‐to‐A.
You can click the linked last name of any user to open that User Record in edit mode. (See Edit Users
below for more information.)
• First‐‐The user’s first name. You can sort the table alphabetically by first name. Click the linked column
header once to sort from A‐to‐Z, click again to sort from Z‐to‐A.You can click the linked first name of
any user to open that User Record in edit mode. (See Edit Users below for more information.)
• User ID‐‐ The User ID assigned to the user. (This is the User ID entered on the login screen.) You can sort
the table alphabetically by User ID. Click the linked column header once to sort from A‐to‐Z, click again
to sort from Z‐to‐A.
• Role‐‐ The role assigned to the user. (See Roles below.) This column is not sortable.
• Phone‐‐ The user’s phone number. (Typically you will see only the first portion of the phone number
displayed, as shown in the above screen capture. Place your mouse over it to see the complete phone
number.) This column is not sortable.
• Email‐‐ The email address assigned to the user. This is the email address to which all password reset
emails will be sent. (Typically you will see only the first portion of the email address displayed, as
shown in the above screen capture. Place your mouse over it to see the complete email address.) This
column is not sortable.
• Status‐‐ Indicates whether the user is “Active” or “Inactive.” Inactive users cannot login to ADP
Payments. This column is not sortable.
• Action‐‐ This column contains the Edit menu. Click the Edit button to open the menu, then click on the
link for the function you want to access. From this menu you can access edit, and delete functions.
Chapter 8: Settings : Users 443
ADD USERS
Follow these steps to add a new user:
1. At the bottom of the Users dashboard, click the “add a new user” button.
2. The Add user screen opens, as shown below:
3. Enter the user’s First name. (Required)
4. Enter the user’s Last name. (Required)
5. Enter the user’s Phone number. (Optional)
6. Enter the user’s Email address.
NOTE: Double check that you have the correct email address, since this is the address to which the user’s
temporary password and any future password resets will be sent.
7. Enter a User ID, which must contain at least 6 characters.
NOTE: This User ID must be unique in the entire ADP Payments system, not just within your account. Keep
this in mind when creating it. Using an email address is typically a safe choice.
You can add as many users to your ADP Payments account as required. There are no
additional fees for multiple users.
For security reasons, User IDs and passwords should never be shared. Be certain that
each person who needs to access your ADP Payments account is given their own User ID.
Chapter 8: Settings : Users 444
8. Enter Notes about the user in the provided text area. (Optional)
9. Click the “save changes” button to continue. (Or click the “cancel” button to discard the user and return to
the Users dashboard.)
10. The Please Select Role pop‐up screen will open.
11. Select the radio button for the role you want to assign to the new user.
NOTE: When you select a radio button the permissions granted to that role will be displayed in the ROLE
DETAILS and ROLE’S ACCESS RIGHTS sections. You cannot edit roles from this screen. (See Roles for a
description of the built‐in roles, and for instructions on how to add, edit, and delete custom roles.)
12. Click the “select role and save” button to create the user (or click the “cancel” button to discard the user
and return to the users dashboard.)
Once you save a user the User ID assigned cannot be changed. Thus, it is a good idea to
make sure that the person for whom you are creating an ADP Payments user account is
happy with the User ID before saving it.
Chapter 8: Settings : Users 445
  a. If there is an error, you’ll see an error message indicating elements that need to be corrected. Click
“ok” to close the error message and return to the Add user screen. Make the required correction(s)
and click the “save changes” button at the bottom of the screen to continue. For example, if you
entered a User ID that already exists in ADP Payments, you would see an error message like the one
below:
13. You will return to the Users dashboard, and the user you just created will be at the bottom of the Users
table, with a status of “Active.”
14. The system will send one email to the user containing the User ID and login url. A second email will be sent
containing a temporary one‐time‐use password.
NOTE: These emails will be sent to the email address entered in the Email field when the user was created.
If the emails are not received, double check that the email address was entered correctly. If it was, have the
person check SPAM and junk folders for the email.
15. When the User logs in for the first time they will be prompted to set a personal password and will be
required to set a security question.   Setting a Security Question will enable the User to re‐set a forgotten
password from the log‐in screen without assistance. (See Managing Your Security Question above for more
information.)
Once a user is created, you can edit, disable, or delete the user as required.
EDIT USERS
User Records can be opened in edit mode by clicking the “Edit User Information” link in the Edit menu in the Action
column on the Users table, or by clicking the linked First name or Last name of the user in the Users table.
You can edit the name, phone number and email address for your own user. However,
you cannot change the role assigned to your own user.
If you need to change your role, contact any user on your account with an
“Administrator” role and they can make the change for you.
Chapter 8: Settings : Users 446
There is no view only mode for User Records. To view full user details, open the User Record in edit mode. The Edit
User screen is shown below:
The screen contains the following elements, some of which can be changed and others which are display only:
• First name‐‐ Enter new text to change this field.
• Last name‐‐Enter new text to change this field.
• Phone‐‐ Enter new text to change this field.
• Email‐‐ Enter a new email address to change this field.
NOTE: This will change the email address to which password reset emails are sent.

“reset password” link to send the user an email with a new temporary password.
NOTE: If the user is ever locked out of ADP Payments due to excessive failed logins, the only way to
unlock the account is to click the “reset password” link on this screen to issue a new temporary
password.
• Role‐‐ This field indicates the role currently assigned to the user. Click the “manage roles” link to open
the Please select role pop‐up window and select a different role for the user. (See Roles below for
more information.)
NOTE: You cannot change the role assigned to your own user.
• User Status‐‐ Indicates whether the User is “Active” or “Inactive.” Select the radio button for the status
you want to set for the user. Inactive users cannot login to ADP Payments.
NOTE: You cannot set your own user to “Inactive.”
• Notes‐‐ Enter or remove any text in this field.
Click the “save changes” button at the bottom of the screen to save your changes and return to the Users
dashboard. Click the “cancel” button to discard the changes.
Chapter 8: Settings : Users 447
RESET PASSWORDS FOR USERS
Any user with an “Administrator” role, and any user with a role that includes the “Add or set users and roles”
permission can reset a password for other users. (See Roles below.)
Follow the steps below to reset a password for a regular user in your account:
1. Locate the user in the Users dashboard table. Open the User Record in edit mode by clicking the Edit button
then clicking the “Edit User Information” link, or by clicking the linked First name or Last name of the user.
2. In the Account Access section of the Edit User screen, click the “reset password” link.
3. A pop‐up window will appear asking you to confirm that you want to reset the password. Click “Reset
Password” to continue, or “Cancel” to leave the password as is.
Only ADP Payments Customer Care can reset a password for a Master Administrator
User who has been locked out of the system due to excessive failed login attempts.
Chapter 8: Settings : Users 448
4. Another pop‐up window will appear confirming that the password has been reset. Click “ok” to return to
the Edit User screen.
5. The user’s previous password will now be invalid. The user will receive an email with a temporary one‐
time‐use password. After logging in with the temporary password the user will be prompted to change it to
a personal password.
DEACTIVATE USERS
Deactivating a user prevents the user from logging into ADP Payments, but does not remove the User Record from
the system. Once a deactivated user is re‐activated, the user will be able to login again.
NOTE: The Master Administrator User cannot be deactivated.
To Deactivate a User
1. Locate the user you want to deactivate in the Users table.
2. Click the Edit button, then click the “Edit User Information” link, or click the User’s linked first or last name.
The temporary password in a password reset email is valid for only 72 hours (3‐days).
If the temporary password is not used in that time frame, it will be de‐activated and
will need to be reset again.
Users can change their own password from the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Account
Access screen.
They can also re‐set a forgotten password by clicking the “Forgot Password?” link from
the login screen if a Security Question has been set. (See Resetting a Forgotten
Password in Chapter 2 for instructions.)

NOTE: There is no way to retrieve a User Record once it is deleted. However, if you change your mind, you can create
a new user with the same profile as the old one. Once a User Record is deleted, the User ID attached to the deleted
record can be used again in a new User Record.
Chapter 8: Settings : Roles 451
Roles
Each ADP Payments user is assigned a role that provides a set of functional permissions that limit access to the
system.
ADP Payments includes two built‐in roles that cannot be edited: the “Administrator” and the “User” role.
The “Administrator” role provides access to all system functions. This is the role permanently assigned to the Master
Administrator User. (See About the Master Administrator above.)
The “User” role provides access to all payment processing, invoicing, and reporting functions, but does not provide
access to system configuration functions located in the Settings section or to imports.
You can also create custom roles that contain any combination of available role components. Once a custom role is
created, it can be assigned to any user except the Master Administrator User.
Role Management is accessed from the roles tab in the Settings section.
The following sections provide detailed information about the components available for roles, as well as how to
assign, view, add, edit and delete roles.
 ROLE COMPONENTS
Each role is comprised of multiple access rights that govern the ADP
Paymentsfunctionsthat each user can access. Custom roles, in addition
to the “Administrator” and “User” built‐in roles, can be created and
assigned to any user.
When creating custom roles, any combination of access rights can be
selected from the ROLE’S ACCESS RIGHTS section. (See Add Roles
below.)
Chapter 8: Settings : Roles 452

Management table, and in the Role field on individual User Records.
• Role type‐‐ ADP Payments roles are either “Built‐in” or “Custom.”
• Built‐in roles are pre‐configured and added to every ADP Payments account. They cannot be
edited or deleted.
• Custom roles are those that you create by selecting a set of access rights. These roles can be
edited and deleted. (See Add Roles and Edit Roles below.)
• Options‐‐ Provides links for accessing view, edit, and delete functions for roles.
NOTE: For Built‐in roles, only the view link will be visible.
When the Role Management screen opens, one of the roles will be highlighted, and the Options column will read
“Role selected for editing.” Under the table you will see the ROLE DETAILS and ROLE’S ACCESS RIGHTS for the
selected role. For example, in the above screen capture the Custom “Sample Role” role is selected. The sections
below show that the role has been granted all available access rights except imports.

Web Payment Pages
Web Payment Pages are securely hosted web pages that your customers can use to make payments for online
purchases, order services, or pay their bills online. They can also be used to enable your customers to enter their
own recurring payment schedules online.
ADP Payments Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons are accessed from the web payment pages tab in the
Settings section.   
The top section of the screen displays a table of Web Payment Pages, and the bottom section displays a table of Web
Payment Buttons.
You can link to ADP Payments Web Payment Pages from anywhere on your website. You can also include links to
these pages in promotional or marketing emails to customers. Additionally, you can include the urls for your Web
Payment Pages in printed advertising and marketing materials you send to customers. When you do this, customers
can go online and make purchases in response to your printed offer.
To make linking to Web Payment Pages easier, ADP Payments provides the ability to create Web Payment Buttons.
You design the buttons and select the Web Payment Page to which you want them linked. Buttons can be a graphic,
or a standard text link.   Once the button is configured, simply export the code and paste it into any page on your
website.
To help you start accepting online payments immediately, your ADP Payments account is configured with a default
Web Payment Page and a default Web Payment Button. These can be used as is, or you can edit them as needed. You
can also add as many additional Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons as you like.
The following sections provide detailed information about creating, editing, and managing ADP Payments Web
Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons.  
Web Payment Pages are designed for payments that are not associated with ADP
Payments invoices.
When customers click a “Pay Invoice Now” button in an emailed invoice, they are taken
to a special ADP Payments online invoice screen that contains full invoice details.
Web Payment Pages cannot contain detailed Line Items and Taxes as invoices do. They
can be used only for payment of a “Total” amount, and provide no details about the
individual items included in the total.
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 465
USING WEB PAYMENT PAGES
Web Payment Pages enable customers to make payments to you online. You can create them with a fixed payment
amount, with a drop‐down box customers use to select one of several pre‐programmed amounts, or with an open
payment amount.
A Web Payment Page is comprised of three components: a login screen, a payment form screen, and a confirmation
screen. All are configured in the New Payment Page Template screen.
A default Web Payment Page is created when your ADP Payments account is enabled. This is a one‐time payment
form that uses your color palette and contact information. You can use it as is, or make changes asrequired. (See The
Default Web Payment Page below for detailed information.)
The WEB PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table, located at the top of the Web Payment Pages dashboard, provides a list
of all Web Payment Pages created in your account.
The table contains the following columns, none of which are sortable:
• Form name‐‐ The name assigned to the Web Payment Page.
• URL‐‐ The url that links to your Web Payment Page. You can copy this and paste it in any web page or
email.
• Actions‐‐ This menu provides access to previewing, editing and deleting Web Payment Pages.
The following sections detail how to add, preview, link, edit and delete Web Payment Pages.
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 466
The Default Web Payment Page
Your ADP Payments account is configured with a default Web Payment Page that is ready to use out of the box. You’ll
see it in the WEB PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table, when you access the Settings‐‐> web payment pages tab.
You can begin accepting online payments immediately, by copying the link in the URL column, and using it in a web
page. You can also use any of the linking methods described in the Link to a Web Payment Page section below.
Additionally, you can export the default Web Payment Button, which is attached to the default Web Payment Page,
and paste it in your web pages and emails. (See The Default Web Payment Button and Export a Web Payment Button
below for instructions on how to do this.)
Design of the Default Web Payment Page
The system uses default colors and the contact information you configured for your ADP Payments system to create
the default Web Payment Page. (See Add a Web Payment Page below for detailed information on each section of a
Web Payment Page.) The following settings are used:
• The User ID attached to the form is the Master Administrator User.
• There is no header logo.
• The Page title is “Payment Form.”
• The form accepts payment via Echeck (ACH), American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover.
NOTE: If your account is not configured for all of these payment types, your payment form will only
accept the types of payment supported in your system.
• The Invoice # is included on the form.
• The Recurring billing schedule radio button is set to “none.” This means the form can be used for one‐
time payments only.
• The Terms and Conditions use generic default text that is appropriate for most merchants.
It is strongly recommended that you review and edit the default Terms and Conditions
prior to using the default web form. It is a good idea to add a specific description of the
products and services sold via the form, as well as to clearly define your company’s
return, cancellation and refund policy.
See Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions for sample Terms and Conditions to use on
web payment forms.
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 467
• The Payment amounts field is set to “User defined amount” which means that your customers can
enter the amount they want to pay on the form. (See Add a Web Payment Page below for details on
how to create payment forms with a fixed amount.)
• Shipping address fields are not included.
• The Payment button text is “Pay.”
• The Font is “Arial.”
• Black is used for all color settings, except the payment button text which is white.
• For the login page, the Login logo is not included and the Accent color is grey.
• The Contact Information fields use the information you entered in the Contact information section of
the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Preferences screen.
To preview the payment form and the login page for the default Web Payment Page, hover your mouse over the
Action box and select the “Preview payment form” and “Preview Login Page” links respectively, from the list. (See
Preview a Web Payment Page below for details.)
If you’re not happy with the defaults, you can edit the default Web Payment Page to better meet your needs. (See
Edit a Web Payment Page below for instructions on how to do this.)
If you don’t want to keep the default Web Payment Page you can delete it by selecting the “Delete” link from the
Actions list.
NOTE: If you delete the default Web Payment Page there is no way to restore it. Deleting the default Web Payment
Page will also require that you first delete the default Web Payment Button attached to it. (See Delete a Web
Payment Page below for details.)
Add a Web Payment Page
Follow the steps below to create a new Web Payment Page.
Before releasing a Web Payment Page link, or a Web Payment Button, to your
customersit is very important that you run a test transaction on the Web Payment Page
first. You need to do this even if you are using the Default Web Payment Page.
In the unlikely event of a configuration problem with your account, there will be no
record of failed transaction attempts made via Web Payment Pages. By testing each
form before providing it to your customers, you ensure that you will not encounter any
problems or lose any customer orders.

Confirmation Screen
Preview a Web Payment Page
There are three components to a Web Payment Page: the login screen, the payment form, and the confirmation
screen. All components are configured when creating a Web Payment Page. (See Add a Web Payment Page above.)
After the Web Payment Page is created, you can preview the login screen and the payment form. There is no
preview available for the confirmation screen. It is a very good idea to preview before linking to the forms from your
website or emails, since it will help you identify errors before your customers see them.
You cannot process payments from the Preview screens. When you copy the url for
creating links to Web Payment Pages in your website, be certain that you copy the url
from the URL column in the WEB PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table, and NOT from your
browser bar while previewing the login screen or the payment form. (See Link to a Web
Payment Page below for instructions on how to manually create links to Web Payment
Pages.)
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 484
Preview the login screen for a Web Payment Page
Click the Action button for the form you want to preview, then click the “Preview Login Page” link.   
A new browser window will open with your login screen in preview mode.   
If you don’t like how it looks, edit the LOGIN PAGE CONFIGURATION section of the Web Payment Page and preview
again. (See Edit a Web Payment Page below.) Keep editing and previewing until you are satisfied.
Preview the Payment Form for a Web Payment Page
Click the Action button for the form you want to preview, then click the “Preview Payment Form” link.   
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 485
A new browser window will open with your Payment Form screen in preview mode. You cannot process payments
from this screen.
If you don’t like the way it looks, edit the Web Payment Page and preview again. (See Edit a Web Payment Page
below.) Keep editing and previewing until you are satisfied.
NOTE: There is currently no preview available for the confirmation screen. To preview the confirmation screen, go to
the live payment form (using the link in the URL column of the table), and make a payment via the form. You will
then see the confirmation screen. Be sure to void the payment in ADP Payments when you’re done previewing. (See
Voiding Transactions in Chapter 4.)
Edit a Web Payment Page
You can edit any Web Payment Page to change the included fields, the payment types accepted, whether it will
enable schedule entry, the color scheme, the terms and conditions, and/or the contact information used on the
form. Follow the steps below:
1. Locate the form you want to edit in the WEB PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table on the Web Payment Pages
dashboard.
2. Click the Action button for the form you want to edit, then click the “Edit” link.
3. The Edit Payment Form screen opens, as shown below.
NOTE: The page header will indicate the Payment Form ID referenced in the WEB PAYMENT BUTTONS
table. (See Using Web Payment Buttons.)
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 486
For example, in this screen capture, the Payment Form ID is 290.
4. Make changes to any of the fields in any section of the Web Payment Page. (See Add a Web Payment Page
above for detailed descriptions of all fields and sections on a Web Payment Page.)
5. When you’re done, click the “save” button to save your changes. Or click the “back to payment page &
buttons list” to discard them and leave the page as is.
6. You return to the WEB PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table, where you can preview your changes. (See
Preview a Web Payment Page above.)
Link to a Web Payment Page
You can link to a Web Payment Page by using a Web Payment Button, as described in the Using Web Payment
Buttons section below.
You can also manually create links to Web Payment Pages by using the URL provided in the WEB PAYMENT PAGE
TEMPLATES table on the Web Payment Pages dashboard.
There are two ways to create manual links to Web Payment Pages. The first is to link to the Web Payment Page login
screen, and the second is to bypass the login page and link directly to the payment form.
Link to a Web Payment Page Login Screen
The preferred way to link to a Web Payment Page is by first directing your customers to the login screen. From there,
they can click a button to go directly to the payment form, or they can enter their User ID and Password to retrieve
stored address and payment account information for use with making the payment.
Logging in saves your customers time, because most of the information on the form is supplied for them, so they
don’t need to go hunting for account numbers in order to make a payment. However, some customers don’t want to
create an account just to make a single payment, which is why ADP Payments offers both options on the login
screen.
Logging in attaches a payment to an existing Customer Record in ADP Payments, which
makes it easier for you to keep track of customer activity.
Each time your customers make payments via a Web Payment Page without logging in a
new Customer Record is created in ADP Payments, which can result in multiple
Customer Records for a single person.
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 487
To insert a link to a Web Payment Page in a web page or email, simply copy the URL code found in the WEB
PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table for the payment form, and paste it in as the link URL.
For example, the HTML code that links to the Payment Plan Form in the above screen capture would look like this:
<a href=”https://payments.paysimple.com/Payments/Login/CheckOutFormLogin/
ONwzJoM7BHSoRIbjkU7p2KNrYmI‐”> Click to Check Out Now </a>
Link to a Web Payment Page Payment Form
If you don’t want any of your customers to login when making payments on your Web Payment Pages, you can
create a link that bypasses the login screen. Follow the steps below to do this:
1. Locate the Web Payment Page you want to link to in the WEB PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table.
2. Highlight the URL for the page to which you want to link, and copy it (Ctrl + C).
3. Open a web browser, and paste (Ctrl + V) the url into the browser bar, and click enter to go to the login
screen for the Web Payment Page.
4. Click the “Click Here to Pay Now” button on the login screen.
5. The payment form will open in your web browser.
6. Copy the complete URL from the browser bar.
7. Paste the url you copied into any web page to link directly to the payment form. For example, HTML code
linking directly to a payment form would look like this:
<a href=”https://payments.paysimple.com/Payments/Buyer/CheckOutFormPay/
ONwzJoM7BHSoRIbjkU7p2KNrYmI‐”>Click to Check Out Now </a>

return to the WEB PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table.
5. The Web Payment Page you deleted will no longer appear in the WEB PAYMENT PAGE TEMPLATES table.
If you delete a Web Payment Page, any exported buttons linking to it will stop working
(when clicked they will result in a page‐not‐found browser error), even if you edit the
Web Payment Button in ADP Payments.
Any edits you make to Web Payment Buttons will not affect buttons that you have
already exported. If you want to change those buttons, you will need to export the
button again and replace the button code in your web page. (See Export a Web
Payment Button below.)

USING WEB PAYMENT BUTTONS
Web Payment Buttons can be text links or graphic buttons that link to specific Web Payment Pages. They can be
placed on any page of your website, or added to promotional emails.
NOTE: To place a graphic button in an email, you must use HTML email format, and have access to the HTML code.
When customers click this button on your website or in an email they will be sent to the linked Web Payment Page.
A default Web Payment Button is created when your ADP Payments account is enabled. It is linked to the default
Web Payment Page. You can use it as is, or make changes as required. (See The Default Web Payment Button below
for detailed information.)
The WEB PAYMENT BUTTONS table, located at the bottom of the Web Payment Pages dashboard, provides a list of
all buttons created in your account.
The table contains the following columns, none of which are sortable:
• Payment button‐‐ Displays a preview of how the button will appear on web pages.
NOTE: In the above screen capture, the first two rows contain graphic buttons, and the third row
contains a standard link.
• Payment form ID‐‐ Displays the ID for the Web Payment Page to which the button is linked.
NOTE: To view the ID for a Web Payment Page, open it in edit mode. The heading on the screen will
provide the ID. (See Edit a Web Payment Page.)
• Action‐‐ Click the “Export Button” link in this column to copy the button code to your computer’s
clipboard. Once you do this, you can paste the code into a web page or email.
• Actions‐‐ This menu provides access to edit and delete functions. Click the Action button, then click
the link for the function you want to use.
The following sections detail how to add, export, edit and delete Web Payment Buttons.
You must have at least one Web Payment Page BEFORE you create a Web Payment
Button. (As long as you don’t delete the default Web Payment Page you’re fine to start
creating buttons.)
When creating a button, you must select a Web Payment Page to associate with it. You
can always go back later and edit the button to associate it with a different Web
Payment Page.
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 491
The Default Web Payment Button
Your ADP Payments account comes configured with a default Web Payment Button that is ready to use right out of
the box. You’ll see it in the WEB PAYMENT BUTTONS table, when you accessthe Settings‐‐> web payment pagestab.
You’ll see a preview of how the button will look on a web page, in the Payment button column of the table.
The button is attached to the default Web Payment Page. (See The Default Web Payment Page above.) You can
export it and paste it into a web page to begin accepting online payments immediately. Simply click the “Export
Button” link in the Action column, copy the code in the pop‐up window, and paste that code into your HTML page.
(See Export a Web Payment Button below for detailed instructions.)
Design of the Default Web Payment Button
The system uses default settings for button configuration, as shown below:
• The Button type is a graphic “Button.”
• The Button label is “Pay.”
• The Button background color is black.
• The Button foreground color (the button text color) is white.
• The Font is Arial, 10px, plain.
• The Payment form is the “Default Payment Form.”
Chapter 8: Settings : Web Payment Pages 492
If you’re not happy with the defaults, you can edit the default Web Payment Button to better meet your needs. (See
Edit a Web Payment Button below for instructions on how to do this.)
If you don’t want to keep the default Web Payment button you can delete it by selecting the “Delete” link from the
Action menu.
NOTE: If you delete the default Web Payment Button there is no way to restore it. If you have exported the default
Web Payment Button and are using it in a web page, deleting the button from ADP Payments will not affect the
button function in the web page‐‐ as long as you have not also deleted the default Web Payment Page. (See the
Delete a Web Payment Button section for details.)

Import Center
In addition to manually entering customers, one‐time payments, recurring payment schedules, and invoice list items
ADP Payments provides an import feature which allows you to import batch files of multiple customers, payments,
payment schedules, and items at once.
Using the import feature is a fast and easy way to import a customer database and items catalog into ADP Payments
so you can get up and running quickly. It is also a good way to integrate ADP Payments with external customer
management programs. For example, if you have a separate database that you use to manage time‐sheets for
consulting projects, you could export your list of outstanding balances and import them into ADP Payments for
payment processing.
The Import Center is accessed via the import center tab in the Settings section of ADP Payments, or via the
“import” links found on the manage payments, manage recurring payments, manage customers, and manage list
items screens.   
The following sections provide detailed information about the types of imports you can perform, how to prepare
your files, how to import the files, and how to track progress and troubleshoot imports from the Import Center
dashboard.
TYPES OF IMPORT BATCHES
ADP Payments supports four types of imports: Customers, Payments, Recurring Payments and List Items. Each of
these import types is outlined below. (See Appendix C: Import Requirements for detailed information on the specific
fields supported and required for each import type.)
• Customer
Customer imports are comprised of two sections: information about the customer (name, company,
billing address, phone, email, etc.) and the customer’s payment accounts.   
You can import one bank account and one credit card account for each Customer Record. These
accounts will be labeled as the “default” accounts for this customer. Importing a payment account with
a Customer Record is optional.
The customer import batch is used for importing a customer list, with or without payment account
information, into ADP Payments without processing any transactions for the imported customers.
Currently ADP Paymentssupports only U.S. and Canadian addresses. You cannot import
customers with addresses in any other country.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 500
• Payment
Payment imports are used to process one‐time payments. When the payment import file is uploaded,
the system immediately creates new customers for each row without a Customer ID, processes a credit
card or Echeck (ACH) payment for each customer in the file, and emails a receipt for that payment.
There are two payment import row formats, and a single payment import file can contain a
combination of both formats:
• Existing Customer Payment Import Row
This import row format is used if you have a Customer ID for the person being charged. You
provide the ADP Payments Customer ID and the amount and type of payment. The system
processes the payment using the default account for the payment type selected. (See About
Default Payment Accounts in Chapter 6 for information about default accounts)
• New Customer Payment Import Row
This import row format is used when you want to create a new customer in ADP Payments and
process a payment for that customer at the same time. Your import file must contain all required
fields for a Customer Record and all required fields for a one‐time payment.
• Recurring Payment
Recurring payment imports are used to enter and activate recurring payment schedules for both billing
schedules and payment plan schedules. When the recurring payment import file is uploaded, the
system immediately creates new customers for each row without a Customer ID, activates the
schedules, sends an email to the customer confirming the schedule, and processes a transaction for
any payments scheduled for the current day. It also emails a receipt.
There are two recurring payment import row formats, and a single recurring payment import file can
contain a combination of both import formats:
• Existing Customer Recurring Payment Import Row
This import row format is used if you have a Customer ID for the person being charged. When you
provide the ADP Payments Customer ID along with the schedule details and type of payment, the
system processes the scheduled payments using the default account for the payment type
selected. (See About Default Payment Accounts in Chapter 6 for information about default
accounts.)
• New Customer Recurring Payment Import Row
This import row format is used when you want to create a new customer in ADP Payments and
enter a schedule for that customer at the same time. You must provide all required fields for a
Customer Record and all required fields for a recurring payment schedule.
• Items
The Item import is designed to enable you to import a product or service catalog for use with creating
ADP Payments invoices. Each item is comprised of a name, description and unit price.   
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 501
ABOUT IMPORT BATCH FILES
Each ADP Payments Import type has different field requirements.   The import file must adhere to the following
rules:
• Must be in .csv or pipe‐delimited text format.
NOTE: To convert an Excel file into .csv format, use the “save as” function and select “csv” as the file
type.
• For best results, all fields, even those containing numbers and dates, should be formatted as “text.”
• Must not contain anything but text. (Merge field code, SQL code, javascript, etc., even if in an
unmapped field, will cause the file to be rejected.)
• Must contain values for all required fields, based on Import type.
See Appendix C: Import Requirements for details on the requirements for each Import type.
IMPORT CENTER DASHBOARD
The Import Center dashboard is used for uploading new batches, as well as tracking the status of batches that have
been uploaded. It is accessed from the Import Center tab in the Settings section.
If your role does not provide access to the Settings section, but does provide permission for imports, you will need
to access the Import Center via the links located on the manage payments, manage recurring payments, manage
customers, and manage list items screens, as shown below:
Each section of the Import Center dashboard is described below:
When entering credit card and bank account numbers it is critical that you format the
field as “text.” These numbers can easily become corrupted if not entered as a text
value.
To do this in Excel, enter a ‘prior to the card value. For example, enter
‘5454545454545454’ when entering a MasterCard with a number of
5454545454545454.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 502
• Import File Upload
This section of the dashboard is used for importing a new batch file into ADP Payments for processing.
(See How to Import Batches below for instructions on how to upload batch files.)   
• Imports Queued for Processing
This section of the dashboard contains imported files that ADP Payments has not yet processed. In
most cases, your file will be addressed immediately, and this section will indicate that there are no
queued files. However, if you happen to upload a file at a busy time, the file will sit in the queue until it
can be processed. If your import appears in this section, come back later to check on its progress.
• Imports Needing Attention
This section is used to record import files in which some or all of the rows were not processed
successfully.
Imports are listed from newest‐to‐oldest, 5 rows at a time. Click the “Next” link at the bottom of the
table to navigate through the list.
The first column provides the Name of your import and the second Date uploaded column provides
the date and time of the file upload. The Processed rows column indicates the number of successful
rows processed and the total number of rows in the file. For example, in the first row of the following
screen capture, 1 out of 7 rows were successful.
To see an error report of rows that were not processed and why, click the “View Errors” link.
(See Troubleshooting Import Batch Errors below for more information on understanding row errors
and how to correct them.)
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 503
• Processing Imports
This section of the dashboard displays the import file that ADP Payments is currently processing.
Typically, import files are processed so quickly that they will appear in this section for only a few
seconds. Large files may take longer to process. So if your file sits in this section, come back later to
check on its progress.
• Completed Imports
This section of the dashboard displays all completely successful imports (those in which all of the rows
were successfully processed).
Imports are listed from newest‐to‐oldest, 5 rows at a time. If there are more than 5 imports, click the
“Next” link at the bottom of the table to navigate through the list.
The first column provides the import Name, the second Date uploaded column provides the date and
time the import was uploaded, and the last Processed rows column shows how many rows there were
in the file.   
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 504
HOW TO IMPORT BATCHES
The basic steps for importing a batch file are the same for each Import type, and are outlined below. For detailed
instructions on how to import each type, see the following sections:
• Importing a Customer Batch in Chapter 6
• Importing One‐time Payments in Chapter 4
• Importing Recurring Payment Schedules in Chapter 4
• Importing Item Batches in Chapter 5
From the Import Center dashboard, follow the steps below to import any customer, payment or recurring payment
file:
1. From the Import type drop‐down box select “Customer,” “Payment,” “Recurring payment” or “Items” to
match the type of file you are importing. The file cannot combine multiple Import types.
2. Enter a short descriptive name for your import in the Import name field. This name will be used when
referencing this particular import batch in tables on the Import Center dashboard.
3. Enter a short description of the import in the Import description field. (Optional)
4. In the File type drop‐down box, select the type of file you are importing. You can use a .csv file
(recommended) or a pipe‐delimited text file.
NOTE: To convert an Excel file to .csv, use the “save as” command and select .csv as the file type.
Be sure to prepare your batch file properly. See Appendix C: Import Requirements for
detailed requirements and field parameters for all import types.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 505
5. If the file you are importing contains a header row, check the First row is header checkbox. (Using a header
row is very helpful for the field mapping that you will perform in Step 9.)   If there is no header row, leave
this box unchecked.
6. Click the “Choose File” button to locate the import batch file on your computer.
7. Click “upload” to begin the import process.
8. The system performs a preliminary validation of your file. If it is corrupt or unusable, you will see an error
message. Otherwise, you will see the Field Mapping screen, shown below:
• The first column displays the values in the first row of each column in your file. These will either be the
values in your header row, or the first row of data (if your file does not contain a header row).
• The second column contains drop‐down boxes used to map a field in your file to an ADP Payments
system field.
• The Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box enables you to select a saved mapping schema. (See
About Saved Mapping Schemes below for instructions on using saved mappings.)
• The “reset mapping” button will clear all values in the System Field Names drop‐down boxes so you
can begin the mapping process again.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 506
• The help box, located under the “reset mapping” button provides definitions for all of the ADP
Payments system fields. Select a field name from the drop‐down, and its definition will appear under
the box.
9. For each column you want to map from your file, select a corresponding ADP Payments field from the
associated drop‐down box, as shown below. If you do not want to map a field from your file, leave the
corresponding drop‐down box set to “‐Select Column‐.” Required fields differ for each Import type, are
marked with as asterisk (*), and appear at the top of the System Field Names drop‐down box.
NOTE: Selected fields will disappear from the list of available fields. This prevents you from accidentally
creating duplicate mappings.   
10. When you have finished mapping fields, click the “continue” button.
11. On the next screen, shown below, enter a name for the mapping you just created in the Mapping Name
field. You can select this mapping at a later date from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box to quickly
map a file using the same column structure. (See About Saved Mapping Schemes below.)
NOTE: You are required to save your mapping. Even if you never expect to use it again, storing it will save
time if there is an error processing your file and you need to upload it again.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 507
12. Enter a Description for the mapping. (Optional)
13. Click the “save & continue” button.
14. The Approve File Import For Processing screen appears, as shown below:   
• The top line (in white) contains the ADP Payments system field names, in alphabetical order.
• The second line (in purple) appears only if your file has a header row, and contains the field names in
that header row.
• The following 5 lines (in white) contain the first 5 data rows from your file. You can scroll through them
in the table.
15. Double check that your mapping correctly matched fields in your file to ADP Payments system fields.
  a. If you see an error, click the “back to mapping” button to return to the mapping screen (Step 9.),
correct any errors, and proceed.
  b. When you’re satisfied with the mapping, click the “approve batch” button.
16. When the file is successfully uploaded and queued for processing, you’ll see an on‐screen success message,
as shown below. (If there are errors, you’ll see an on‐screen message indicating the corrections that need
to be made.)
17. Click the “Import Center” link to return to the Import Center dashboard and view the status of your file.
(See Import Center Dashboard above.)
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 508
About Saved Mapping Schemes
A mapping schema is a saved set of file‐to‐system field pairs. Each time you import a file and create a new field
mapping, ADP Payments requires you to save that mapping. (See How to Import Batches above.) The next time you
import a file that uses the exact same column order and File type, you can select the saved mapping so you don’t
have to manually map each field. When you select a saved mapping schema, ADP Payments skips the Save Column
Mapping screen.
Select a Saved Mapping
To select a saved mapping for use with an import file, select the saved mapping schema you want to use from the
Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box on the Map Field Titles screen.
The system retrieves the mapping and displays the System Field Names in each drop‐down box in the saved order.
The fields have greyed out arrows on the drop‐down boxes, indicating that they cannot be edited.
NOTE: Once you select a “Saved Mapping” the system will not permit you to make changes to it, or clear it by
clicking the “Reset Mapping” button.   
Verify that your file fields are mapped to the appropriate System Field Names, and then proceed with the batch
upload process.
Saved mappings do not recognize column header names. They only recognize column
position in the source file as it relates to a particular system field.
For example, a saved mapping schema maps the ADP Payments “Company” field to the
“Company” column in a source file, where “Company” is the first column of that file. If
the saved mapping schema is used with a second source file where the first column is
“Last Name” and the second column is “Company,” the “Last Name” column in the
source file will be mapped to the “Company” field in ADP Payments.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 509
To Remove a Saved Mapping
If the saved mapping schema does not correctly map the fields in the import file, you can select a different mapping
from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box.
To clear a “Saved Mapping” select “Select Schema” from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box.   Then click the
“Reset Mapping” button to clear all selections and being a new mapping.
To Modify a Saved Mapping
You cannot edit a saved mapping. However, you can use a saved mapping as the basis for a new saved mapping
schema. To do this:
1. Select the saved mapping you want to start with from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box.
2. The mapping will be retrieved in greyed‐out uneditable mode.
3. Choose “Select Schema” from the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box.
4. The System Field Names drop‐down boxes retain the mappings from the saved schema, but are now white
and can be changed.
5. Make changes to the System Field Names drop‐down boxes.
6. Click the “continue” button at the bottom of the page to continue with the import process.
7. The Save Column Mapping screen appears and requires you to save the mapping as a “New” mapping. It
does not permit you to overwrite the mapping on which you based the changes.
NOTE: ADP Payments will never apply changes to an existing mapping, even if you use the same name
when you save it. (If you use the same name as an existing mapping, you will end up with two mappings
with the same name in the Choose Saved Mapping drop‐down box.)
You are required to save every mapping. Even if you never expect to use a mapping
again, storing it will save time if there is an error processing your import and you need
to upload it again.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 510
TROUBLESHOOTING IMPORT BATCH ERRORS
Imports containing unsuccessful rows will be listed in the Imports Needing Attention table on the Import Center
dashboard. The table displays the number of failed rows over the total number of rows in the Processed rows
column. To see a detailed list of the problem rows, along with the error(s) in each of those rows, click the “View
Errors” link to open the Import Details screen and error report.
The following sections provide an overview of the Import Details screen and error report, explain common errors,
and provide help with next steps for re‐importing rejected and partially processed rows.
When a import contains failed rows, you cannot correct them from within the same
import file. You need to create a new, corrected, import file that only contains the
failed rows and then import that file into ADP Payments.
Do not make corrections in the original file and import it again.   If you do, then you will
have duplicate customers, items, schedules and transactions for all successful and
partially successful rows.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 511
Import Details Screen and Error Report
The Import Details screen is comprised of two parts. The top portion provides details about the import itself. The
bottom section provides a list of all rows with errors, along with a description of the errors found in each row.
The top Import Details section contains the following fields:
• Import Name‐‐ The name entered for your import in the Import name field during the upload process.
• Import Description‐‐ The description you entered (if any) for your import in the Description field
during the upload process.
• Import ID‐‐ The unique identifier ADP Payments assigned to the import.
• Date and Time Uploaded‐‐ The date and time the import was uploaded into ADP Payments, not the
date and time it was actually processed.
• Uploaded By‐‐ The unique ADP Payments identifier for the user who uploaded the file.
• File Type‐‐ The type of file uploaded. Either “.csv” or “Pipe‐delimited text.”
• First Row is Header‐‐ If you checked the “First row is header” checkbox during the upload process, this
field will be “True.” If you did not check the box, this field will be “False.”
• Mapping Name‐‐ The name of the saved mapping schema used with the import file.
• Mapping Description‐‐ The description (if any) of the saved mapping schema used with the import file.

Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 512
The bottom Error Messages section of the screen contains an entry for each row in your file that was not
successfully processed. The row numbers indicated in the error messages exactly match the row numbers in your
import file.
NOTE: You do not need to make adjustments for a header row. The row number indicated in the error message is the
same row number as the file. For example, if there is an error in the first data row of a file that contains a header
row, ADP Payments will indicate that the error is in “Row 2” not in “Row 1.”
In a file that contains both successful and failed rows, any row number not listed in the Error Messages section was
processed successfully.
Common Import Errors
Rows from import files will appear as an error when there are problems with customer fields, payment account
fields, payment transaction fields, and recurring payment transaction fields. Some of these errors will cause the
entire row to be discarded, and others will allow a new Customer Record to be added and cause only the payment or
payment schedule entry to fail.
There are many possible errors that can occur in import files. The Error Messages section of the Import Details
screen provides a detailed explanation for each failed row.   The following are some of the most common errors that
occur for each Import type:
 Customer Imports
• Customer with a User ID (User Name) that already exists in the system.
The entire row will fail and the Customer Record will not be added.
• Invalid U.S. state abbreviation or zip code.
The entire row will fail and the Customer Record will not be added.
• Invalid bank routing number.
The Customer Record will be added, but the bank account will not.
• Invalid credit card number or credit card type.
The Customer Record will be added, but the credit card account will not.
• Invalid credit card expiration date.
The entire row will fail, and the Customer Record will not be added.
• Invalid value '{value}' given for drop‐down custom field '{Field Name}'. Provide a valid value (not
display label) as defined in the custom field setup.
The entire row will fail, and the Customer Record will not be added.
NOTE: Values in custom drop‐down fields are cases sensitive, so if you see this error double check your
data. For example, if you have a custom field configured with a display text of “Large” and a value of “L”
and you enter “l” for the field in your import file, the import row will fail. It will also fail if you enter
“Large” in the field. The only valid import value is a capital “L.”
• “Insufficient customer information. Customer Identifier or Full customer information must be
provided.”
The entire row will fail and the Customer Record will not be added.
NOTE: This error can occur if you do not include data for all fields required as part of the Customer
Record. (See Customer Import Requirements.)
This error also occurs when you have a stray row at the end of your file in which one cell contains a
space. To eliminate this error, delete all rows after your last row of data prior to saving the file.

Customer Record will be created.
• Recurring Amount is 0 or negative.
The schedule is not entered. If this row contained data for adding a new customer, and this was the
only error, the new Customer Record will be created.
Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 514

Chapter 8: Settings : Import Center 515
Partially Processed Rows
When there are errors with rows in an import batch, the rows will appear in ADP Payments as “Not Processed” even
if a portion of the data in the row has been saved in your system.
There are two cases where rows are partially processed:
1. In a Customer import where all required fields for creating the customer are present and correct, but bank
account and/or credit card fields have errors. In this case, the following occurs:
  a. A new Customer Record is created.
  b. The bank account or credit card that contained errors is not attached to the customer.
2. In a Payment or Recurring Payment import where information is provided for creating a new customer, and
all required customer fields are present and correct, but there is an error with the payment or recurring
payment schedule fields. In this case, the following occurs:
  a. A new Customer Record is created.
  b. Any bank account or credit card that contained errors is not attached to the customer.
  c. The payment is not processed.
  d. The recurring payment schedule is not entered.
To avoid duplicate customers being created in your ADP Payments system, prior to re‐importing a corrected file,
make sure to identify the rows in your import file that failed completely and those that only failed partially.
Rows that failed completely can be corrected and re‐imported into ADP Payments.
For partially failed rows, where a Customer Record was created, you can take one of the following actions:
• Delete the customers added by the import, then correct the import file, and upload it again.
• Manually enter bank account and/or credit card information missing from the Customer Record.
• Manually enter a payment for the customer, including any missing payment account information.
• Manually enter a recurring payment schedule for the customer, including any missing payment
account information.
• For Customer Records created with a bank account or credit card saved, locate the Customer ID
assigned to each customer. (This would happen if you had errors only in the payment details or
recurring payment schedule details.) Then create a new Payment or Recurring Payment import file
using the Customer ID and saved payment information, and import it into ADP Payments. (See
Importing Payments for Existing Customers and Importing Recurring Payment Schedules for Existing
Customers in Chapter 4.)

Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions
Obtaining the proper authorization for the transactions you process, in conjunction with implementing strong fraud
prevention policies, are the most important steps you can take to protect yourself against disputes, return fees, and
chargebacks.
Authorizations protect both you and your customers. They provide a record of your customer's approval of a
transaction, and they enable you to provide proof that you had permission to process a transaction in the event that
your customer later claims the transaction was not authorized.
Implementing security policies and card authorization procedures designed to detect fraudulent transactions before
they are processed prevents the significant time involved in defending a disputed charge, and saves you the
substantial fees assessed for chargebacks (not to mention the money you lose on the original transaction itself).
The following sections provide guidance on how to obtain the proper authorization for one‐time and recurring
Echeck (ACH) and credit card transactions, help for understanding and preventing chargebacks, and tips on using the
fraud prevention tools available to you as part of ADP Payments.
Also provided are authorization form templates that can be customized for your business when it needs to obtain
written authorizations.   When using the templates, enter your business information in all the red entry fields‐‐ for
example where you see <Insert Business Name>, you would remove that text, type your business name, and change
the font color to black.
The following sections provide details on how to authorize credit card and Echeck (ACH) transactions, in addition to
sample language and templates you can use for authorization forms, receipts, and terms and conditions.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 517
Authorizing Credit Card Transactions
Authorizations for credit card transactions are designed to protect both you and your customers.  They provide a
record of your customer's approval of a transaction, and they enable you to prove to your processor and to the card
issuer that you had permission to process a transaction in the event that your customer later claims the transaction
was not authorized.
While taking these steps will not 100% protect you from chargebacks, (your customers can still ask that a charge be
reversed because they claim that the product or service received was not as advertised), they can go a long way
towards significantly reducing them by minimizing the risk that your transactions will be challenged as fraudulent or
not authorized, and providing you the proof you need to defend a transaction should it be questioned.
The following sections provide guidance on how to obtain the proper authorization for one‐time and recurring
credit card transactions, and tips on using the fraud prevention tools available to you as part of ADP Payments. The
last section discusses credit card chargebacks and what you can do to protect and defend yourself.
You'll find more details and handy templates in each section of the guide.

ONE-TIME CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION MAIL & TELEPHONE
AUTHORIZATION GUIDE
Credit card orders received via mail or over the telephone are known as card‐not‐present transactions, which means
that you do not physically have the card in hand when authorizing the payment. However, you do need to enter your
customer’s billing address in order to process these transactions via ADP Payments.
The following sections provide instructions for authorizing telephone and written one‐time credit card transactions.
One-time Telephone Transaction Authorizations
Typical Uses: one‐time telephone transactions are typically used when a customer is making a purchase over the
phone, or paying a bill over the phone.  For example:
• Ordering an item from a catalog.
• Making a payment on an invoice received in the mail.
• Leaving a deposit on a large purchase that will be completed in person at a later date.
How to Authorize:
1. Get verbal authorization over the phone from you customer.
2. Send a receipt via email or regular mail .

making a single payment for product or services rendered. For example:
• Making a down payment when a contract for home improvements is signed.
• Mailing an order for goods from a catalog.
• Making a charitable donation.
How to Authorize:  
1. Have your customer sign and date a form that includes:
  a. The amount of the payment.
  b. The date the payment is to be processed.
  c. The credit card account number and expiration date from which the payment is to be debited.  
2. Keep this form on file, in digital or paper form, for at least one year.
3. Send a receipt via email or regular mail .
ADP Payments provides three options for sending email receipts:
• In the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen, check the “Send a receipt
to the customer” checkbox in the TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section.  Alternately, you can manually
check the “Send a receipt to the customer” checkbox on each one‐time payment or recurring payment
schedule.

Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 522
RECURRING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION TELEPHONE
AUTHORIZATION GUIDE
You are permitted to authorize recurring schedules over the phone that debit a credit card account. The
authorization requires that your customer understand the conditions under which the business is permitted to debit
the account (such as amount, date, and frequency), as well as conditions for termination or change of the
authorization.
Typical Uses: There are three typical uses for recurring credit card transactions:
• Payments for the same amount on a regular schedule, such as weekly or monthly service fees.
• Payments for a different amount on a regular schedule, such as utility bills.
• Payment plans for discharging a large debt, such as installment payments on a large purchase.
How to Authorize:
1. Get verbal authorization over the phone from your customer to authorize the schedule.
2. Send your customer a schedule confirmation via mail or email that includes:
• The amount of the recurring transaction (or the amount range for a variable schedule).
• The frequency of the debits (how often you will charge your customer).
• The schedule start date, and end date (if defined).
• Instructions for terminating the schedule.
• Your business address and a phone number answered during regular business hours.
3. Mail or email a receipt for each payment made as part of the schedule.
4. Mail or email notification to your customer at least 10 days in advance of any change to the schedule
amount or frequency.

setting for pre‐notification emails is “on” with the pre‐notification sent 1 day prior to the payment date. You can
change this on a global basis in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen. Select the
“No” radio button for pre‐notifications if you don’t want to send it. Or, change the number of days prior (choose
from 1 to 10 days) that the pre‐notification email is sent. You can also make this change on a case‐by‐case basis for
each individual recurring payment schedule when you create it.

What ADP Payments Does For You:
The Web Payment Pages you create as part of your ADP Payments system automate most of the authorization steps
for you, including displaying terms and conditions on your payment form, automatically generating a transaction
confirmation page and automatically emailing a receipt. To complete the process, you need to do the following:
• When creating a new Web Payment Page (see Add a Web Payment Page in Chapter 8) be certain to
include all required language for authorizing online credit card transactions in the Terms and
Conditions field. (See Sample Language for Authorizing Recurring Credit Card Transactions Online
below.)
• Be certain to complete the Contact Information section of the Web Payment Page with current contact
information for your company. The phone number and email address provided must be monitored and
answered during regular business hours.
• In the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templatesscreen, check the “Send a receipt
to the customer” checkbox in the TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section.
• Make certain that you keep copies of all receipts. To do this, in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templates screen, check the “Send a receipt to my company at” checkbox in the
TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section and enter your email address in the field.
• Make certain that you send new schedule notifications to your customers and that you keep copies. To
do this, in the RECURRING PAYMENT REMINDERS section of the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen, for the “Do you want to send emailsfor new and updated recurring
payment schedules?” question, check the “Send notification to the customer” check box and the
“Send notification to my company at” checkbox and enter your email address in the field. (See Email
Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for instructions.)
Should your customer ever request a copy of the recurring schedule details you can print a copy or email a copy
using the “Print” or “Email” links in the Actions drop‐down box for the schedule on the manage recurring payments
screen. To resend a receipt from an automatically generated transaction, you can print a copy or email a copy using
the “Print” or “Email” links in the Actions drop‐down box for the transaction in the manage payments screen.
Sample Language for Authorizing Recurring Credit Card Transactions Online
When configuring your Web Payment Page, add the following text to the Terms and Conditions field, in addition to
your company’s standard terms and conditions.

FRAUD PREVENTION GUIDE FOR MAIL, TELEPHONE & ONLINE CREDIT CARD
TRANSACTIONS
Mail, telephone and online credit card transactions are inherently more risky than in‐person transactions, as you
never physically have possession of or see the credit card.  Thus you must rely on other methods to determine if the
person making the payment is an authorized user of the card.
A combination of technology and common sense can go a long way toward preventing fraudulent transactions. The
simple precautionary steps you take make a significant difference in protecting your business and your customers.
The following are some suggestions on what to do.
Using AVS Match
AVS (Address Verification System) requires you to get a billing address from your customer and during the
transaction authorization process matches that address to the one the credit card issuer has on file for the card.
Having this information is an important fraud investigation tool for credit card issuers, and is extremely helpful in the
case a transaction is disputed. In fact, performing this check is so important that you will be charged more to process
a transaction if you do not perform the AVS check‐‐ This is why ADP Payments requires that you enter an address for
each customer so that the system can perform an AVS check on every transaction processed.
However, ADP Payments will process the transaction regardless of the AVS result because there are a number of
reasons why it might fail for a valid transaction. For example, the AVS system may be momentarily down, the card
may not be found in the AVS system, or your customer moved recently and the AVS system hasn’t yet caught up.
NOTE: To avoid an extra charge you are required to perform the AVS check‐‐ not to get a positive response.
Using CID/CVV2 Match
The CVV2 Code (also known as the CID Number) is an identification number located on the credit card that is not
part of the card number itself. For Visa, MasterCard and Discover it is the three digit number printed on the back of
the card located near the signature line. For American Express it is a 4 digit number located on the front of the card
on the right side, just above the credit card number.
The idea behind the CVV2 code is to provide merchants processing card‐not‐present transactions with some proof
that the person authorizing the transaction actually has the card in hand. Performing this type of check is protection
against fraudulent transactions being initiated by someone who has stolen credit card numbers, because the CVV2
code is never stored in any payment processing system. Thus even if a database of card numbers is stolen, the thief
would never be able to steal the CVV2 codes that go with the cards.
Performing a CVV2 match is not required, and you will not be charged more if you do not do it (except for Discover
transactions, which do charge more if the check is not performed). However, proof of a CVV2 match on an
authorization can help you defend yourself in the event of a chargeback.
In ADP Payments the CVV2 check is automatically performed when the value is entered on a one‐time payment form
or web payment form (CVV2 is always a required field on web payment forms). The transaction will process
regardless of the result, however the result will be noted as part of the transaction record.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 528
Identifying Fraud
In addition to validation during the authorization process, there is much you can do to train your employees to
identify fraudulent transactions before even attempting to process them.  Even with all the technological tools at
your disposal, it is possible for an expert thief to beat them.  So start with the premise that if something sounds fishy
or too good to be true, it probably is‐‐ and you should think twice about accepting the order.   
The following guides provided by Visa can help you put effective policies and procedures in place, and train your
employees:
• Heads Up to the Warning Signs of Fraud
• If the Card is NOT There‐‐ You Need to be More Aware
• Take the Order‐‐ But Don’t Get Taken In
Protecting Your Customers' Information
In addition to protecting your company from processing fraudulent transactions, you are also responsible for
protecting your own customers' information from being compromised.  
Utilizing ADP Payments for all of your electronic storage of cardholder data is a smart first step towards compliance.
Once a credit card number is encrypted and securely stored in ADP Payments’s PCI Certified system, you can perform
additional transactions without the need for external access to the full number again.
But, if you store card holder data in paper form‐‐such a signed authorization forms for recurring schedules‐‐you
need to make certain that those forms are protected. The following are some guidelines to use:
• Store any paper documents containing credit card numbers in a locked file drawer or safe.
• Limit access to documents containing credit card numbers on a need‐to‐know basis.
• Discard (via shredding or incineration) documents containing credit card numbers when there is no
longer a business need to keep them. (For recurring schedule authorizations this is one year after the
last payment made on the schedule.)
• After successfully entering and processing a transaction in ADP Payments (wait until you have
confirmation that the transaction settled), redact (cross‐out with a dark pen) the CVV2 code and all but
the last 4 digits of the credit card number on any paper authorization forms.
If you store authorization forms in digital format, you need to remove the CVV2 number and all but the last 4 digits
of the credit card number (after you have successfully processed a transaction of course.) You can achieve this by
redacting (cross‐out with a dark pen) this information before scanning a written document for storage. Or, if the
authorization form is already in digital format, use a tool such as Microsoft Paint or Adobe Acrobat Standard to
delete it prior to storage.
As part of your PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) Compliance
certification, you should have a security policy in place around how you store and
protect customer information‐‐ including credit card numbers.  
You can learn more about PCI in the PaySimple website PCI Center. (PaySimple is the
company that powers ADP Payments.)

CREDIT CARD CHARGEBACKS
Credit Card chargebacks typically occur when your customers dispute transactions with their credit card companies.  
In some cases they can also occur if the bank that issued the card you charged believes that you violated Visa/
MasterCard/Discover or American Express rules.
If one of your credit card transactions is charged‐back, you will receive notification directly from your credit card
merchant processor. This notification will typically require you to provide proof of authorization for the charge, and
may include other information requests.
The first step in preventing chargebacks is to understand their most common causes, and the second is to take steps
to address them as part of your standard business practices. The following are some suggestions on what to expect
and what you can do.
Most Common Causes of Credit Card Chargebacks
The following are the most common causes for credit card chargebacks, and possible defenses where applicable.
When you receive a chargeback notification from your merchant processor, it will typically reference one of these
reasons.
• Non‐Receipt of Requested Item
If your merchant processor asks you to provide a copy of a receipt or authorization for a transaction,
and you do not supply it by the deadline, the transaction will be deemed a chargeback, and you will
not be able to defend or reverse it. (See Retrieval Request Letter below.)
• Unauthorized Mail Order/Telephone Order Transaction
The Cardholder denies that they authorized a sale by mail or telephone.  This might happen if the
Cardholder does not recognize the charge, or if another authorized user of the account does not
recognize the charge.
• Possible Defense: Supplying a facsimile draft as proof that the order was actually placed,
supplying a copy of a signed authorization received via mail, or providing a telephone recording of
authorization. Because there are no signatures involved in these types of transactions, you should
keep all records of shipping to assist in proving the Cardholder initiated the transaction.
• Duplicate Processing
A Cardholder is charged two or more times for the same transaction, and only authorized one.
• Possible Defense: Supply proof of more than one authorization with different invoice numbers, or
supply proof of credit for the duplicate transaction being made to the Cardholder.
The credit card chargeback dispute process takes place entirely outside the ADP
Payments system.
Currently credit card chargebacks are not updated with the “Chargeback” status in ADP
Payments, they will retain a status of “Settled” even if you receive a chargeback notice
from your merchant processor.
Be sure to take this into account when using ADP Payments reports to reconcile your
bank statements.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 530
• Non‐Receipt of Merchandise
The Cardholder states that they authorized the sale and were billed for the item, but never received
the merchandise.
• Possible Defense: Supply proof of a shipping receipt signed for by the Cardholder.
• Compliance Case
If an issuing bank, MasterCard or VISA deems that a merchant has not complied with the Rules and
Regulations set forth by the Card Organizations, a pre‐compliance case is initiated to the merchant
processor explaining the rule violation that has taken place.  An example would be surcharging fees to
the customers for using a credit card in the merchant's establishment.  MasterCard, VISA and/or your
merchant processing provider may send you a letter of explanation and supporting documentation
covering the violation and explaining any fees or penalties that could be imposed in addition to the
Chargeback. Should you fail to correct the violation, fees or penalties could be assessed or your
merchant processing account could be terminated.
• No Credit Issued
Merchandise is returned, and a credit is not received for processing.
• Possible Defense: Provide proof that a credit was issued.
• Improper Authorization
The sales records or authorization is, or is alleged to have been executed, accepted, endorsed,
completed or assigned improperly, without authority, or not in accordance with the authorization
requirements or any other provisions of your merchant processing Agreement or the Visa/MasterCard
Rules.
• Dissatisfied Cardholder
The Cardholder disputes the sale, quality or delivery (or availability for prearranged pick‐up) of
merchandise or the performance or quality of service covered by the sales records or agreement
accepted by such Cardholder.
• Breach of Duty
The circumstances in which the transaction was authorized and/or executed involved a breach of any
term, condition, representation, warranty or duty you  have under your merchant processing
Agreement or the Visa/MasterCard Rules.
• Split Transaction
Multiple sales records or agreements were executed to avoid the need to obtain authorization
necessary to complete the transaction.
• Law Violation
The extension of credit for merchandise sold or rented or service performed was in violation of law or
the rules or regulations of any governmental agency, whether federal, state, local or otherwise.
• Cardholder Legal Claim
The Cardholder asserts against your merchant processor any claim or defense which the Cardholder
may have as a buyer against you.
• Other
The transaction is otherwise subject to charge back by the Card issuer or Cardholder in accordance
with the Card Organization Rules or applicable law.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 531
The following Chargeback Reasons are unlikely to occur for transactions entered via ADP Payments, because the
system is designed to prevent them:
• A limited purpose business “purchasing card” was accepted without appropriate authorization of the
nature of the goods or services purchased (in addition to the transaction amount).
• The sales record is incorrectly completed, incomplete or illegible.
• The transaction was one for which the authorization and verification was not obtained, or a valid
authorization code is not correctly and legibly printed on the sales draft.
• The price of the merchandise or services shown on the sales draft differs from the amount shown on
the copy of the sales draft delivered to the Cardholder.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 532
What You Can Do to Prevent Credit Card Chargebacks
Your merchant processing provider is the final arbiter in any chargeback decision and at its sole discretion will
uphold the chargeback or rule in your favor. While you are likely to prevail if you have proof of authorization, you
will still be assessed chargeback fees, and have to take the time to gather documentation and defend your case.   
Thus, your best course of action is to do everything possible to prevent Chargebacks, so you'll never have to worry
about defending them.
So as with most business matters, maintaining good customer relationships is the single most important thing you
can do to protect yourself. If customers call you first, you can refresh their memory about authorizations, or if a
mistake was made you can correct it. Even if you end up refunding a transaction that you think is valid, it's a smart
move to do it yourself before the issuing bank and your merchant account provider get involved. Taking preemptive
action will save you chargeback fees, protect your processing record, and hopefully enhance customer satisfaction.
The following are some important steps you can take:
• Follow all the credit card authorization rules to properly authorize all one time and recurring
transactions. (See Authorizing Credit Card Transactions.)
• Tell your customers how the debit will appear on their credit card statements so that they will
recognize it when they see it.
• Make sure your customer remembers the authorization and the details of the authorized charge‐‐this
is particularly important when debits are part of a recurring payment schedule.  Steps you can take:
• Always send a receipt for transactions. (ADP Payments can do this for you automatically with a
single setting‐‐ see Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8.)
• Always send a pre‐notification email in advance of transactions that are part of recurring billing
schedules. (ADP Payments can do this for you automatically with a single setting‐‐ see Email
Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8.)
• Always provide a copy of recurring billing authorizations to your customers.
• Always notify customers of any change in a recurring billing schedule (ADP Payments does this for
you automatically.)
• Remind your customers to tell joint account owners about the authorized charges.
• Always provide a timely response when you receive a Bankcard Retrieval Request.
• This request is generated when one of your customers requests a copy of a receipt or
authorization for a transaction. (See Retrieval Request Letter below) It comes to you directly from
your merchant processor. A sample of the letter you will receive is provided below. It is critical that
you respond to the request in the time frame indicated in the letter. If you do not, the transaction
will be automatically deemed a Chargeback, even if it was properly authorized. (You are required
to keep proof of authorization for 2 years.)
NOTE: You can always print a copy of the transaction details from ADP Payments.
• Encourage your customers to call you first if they have any questions about a charge. Institute a
reasonable refund policy and quickly acknowledge and remedy any errors you may have made.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 533
The Credit Card Chargeback Process
Despite your best efforts, chargebacks do sometimes happen. When a transaction is disputed, the chargeback
process works as follows:
1. The cardholder (your customer) calls the bank that issued the credit card to dispute a charge.
2. The bank contacts your merchant processing provider and informs it of the disputed charge.
3. Your merchant processing provider makes an initial judgment as to the validity of the disputed charge. (It
may request a copy of the receipt for the disputed charge before making a decision‐see Retrieval Request
Letter below).
4. If your merchant processing provider decides the chargeback is valid it will:
  a. Immediately debit your bank account for the amount of the transaction.
  b. Assess a Chargeback Fee that will be debited from your bank account on the next scheduled
transaction fee debit date. (This will vary based on the terms of your merchant processing contract.)
  c. Send you a “Chargeback Debit Advice” letter (see Chargeback Debit Advice Letter below) along with
any supporting documentation available, and a “Chargeback Adjustment Reversal Request” form that
contains instructions on what you need to do to defend your business and have the Chargeback
reversed. This will be sent via mail to your address of record on the same day that your bank account is
debited‐so you may see the debit before you receive the letter.
5. You (the merchant) decide whether to dispute the Chargeback.
  a. If you don't want to dispute it, do nothing. The issue will be considered closed and the reversal of the
charge will be permanent.
NOTE: Chargebacks in excess of 2% of your total processing volume in any 30 day period are grounds
for suspension or termination of your merchant processing account.
  b. If you want to dispute the Chargeback and have it reversed, complete and submit the "Chargeback
Adjustment Reversal Request" form by the date indicated in the "Chargeback Debit Advice" letter.  
Make sure to include all information and documentation requested in the "Merchant Action Necessary
to Remedy Chargeback" section of the form.
6. Your merchant processor reviews the information you provided, and makes a final decision on whether to
reverse the Chargeback. (During this process it may contact the Card Issuer to attempt to collect payment
for the charge based on the information you provide.)
7. You are informed of the final decision. If the chargeback is reversed, the amount of the transaction is
credited back to your bank account.
If you do have a Chargeback please don't hesitate to call ADP Payments Customer Care
for assistance with gathering documentation and defending it. You can also call your
merchant processor's customer service line for assistance.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 534
As part of the chargeback process, you will receive multiple communications from your merchant processing
provider. The following are samples of the two most common letters:
Retrieval Request Letter
Merchants are required to maintain original authorization documents and transaction receipts for a period of two
(2) years. A Cardholder is permitted to request a copy of sales or credit drafts within this time frame. This is known
as a Retrieval Request.
Upon receipt of a Retrieval Request from a Cardholder bank, your merchant processor will mail a Retrieval Request
Letter to your address of record. This form contains pertinent information of the original sale. A legible copy of the
sales receipt and authorization must be faxed or mailed to the address or fax number indicated on the Retrieval
Request Letter within five (5) days. It is important that you retain a copy of all submitted documents for your
records. A sample letter is shown below:
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Credit Card Transactions 535
Chargeback Debit Advice Letter
When your merchant processor has initially validated a chargeback, this letter will be sent to your address of record.
If you want to defend the chargeback and have it reversed, you must supply the information and documentation
requested in the letter by the date indicated. A sample of a Chargeback Debit Advice letter is shown below:
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 536
Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions
Obtaining the proper authorization for your Echeck (ACH) transactions is the most important step you can take to
protect yourself against disputes, return fees, and reversed transactions.
According to NACHA (the organization that oversees the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network) rules, there are
only three reasons people can dispute ACH charges to their account:
1. If it was never authorized by the account holder;
2. If it was processed on a date earlier than authorized; or
3. If it is for an amount different than authorized.
NOTE: The transaction must be for the exact amount authorized‐‐ it cannot be higher or lower. However,
you are permitted to have customers authorize payments for variable amounts, and/or not to exceed
amounts.
That's it. And, disputing an ACH charge requires that the account holder provide notice to the bank in writing (or the
electronic equivalent) that one of those three conditions exists. (Note that this is significantly different from credit
card transactions where a customer can have a charge reversed simply by claiming that the product or service
received was not what they expected.)
The key word is Authorized‐which according to NACHA means something very specific depending on the ACH Type
used to submit the transaction. ADP Payments supports the following ACH Types (though your account many not be
enabled for all of them):
• PPD: Used for a one‐time or recurring business to consumer ACH transaction, for which you have
written authorization‐‐Meaning a signed form or contract.
• TEL: Used for a one‐time business to consumer ACH transaction that was authorized over the
telephone.
• WEB: Used for a one‐time or recurring business to consumer ACH transaction that was authorized by
submitting a form over the Internet.
• CCD: Used for a one‐time or recurring business to business ACH transaction, for which you have
written (mail, email or fax) or telephone authorization in addition to having a general written
agreement with the company for ACH debits to its account.
You must fulfill the authorization requirements for the ACH Type submitted, or your customer can have the charge
reversed. For example, if your customer calls to place an order over the phone, and you process it as a PPD
transaction instead of a TEL transaction, your customer can claim that the transaction was not authorized and have
it reversed.
The following sections provide guidance on how to obtain the proper authorization for each ACH Type, and provide
authorization form templates that can be customized for your business when it needs to obtain written
authorizations. The final section covers ACH Chargebacks and what you can do to prevent them. You'll find more
details and handy templates in each section of the guide.
You CANNOT convert paper checks to Echeck (ACH) transactions using ADP Payments.
ADP Payments supports only PPD, TEL, WEB, and CCD ACH Types. A paper check is not
acceptable authorization for any of these ACH Types.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 537
PPD TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION GUIDE
PPD transactions are by definition those that are authorized in writing on a form or contract that grants a business
permission to debit a consumer's personal checking or savings account.
The authorization form outlines the conditions under which the business is permitted to debit the account (such as
amount, date, and frequency), as well as conditions for termination or change of the authorization.
One-time PPD Transaction Authorizations
Typical Uses: One‐time PPD transactions are often used as part of a contract when a customer is making a single
payment for products or services rendered. For example:
• Paying for a year of service in advance when a service contract is signed.
• Making a major purchase such as furniture, art, or a used vehicle.
• Placing an order for a product or service that will be billed in full on a future date.
How to Authorize:
1. Have your customer sign and date a form that includes the amount of the payment, the date the payment
is to be processed, and the bank account from which the payment is to be debited.
2. Keep this form on file, stored digitally or in paper form, for two years.
Templates Provided:
• One‐time ACH Payment Authorization Form
Use this form to authorize a ONE‐TIME payment.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 538
Recurring PPD Transaction Authorizations
Typical Uses: There are three typical uses for recurring PPD transactions:
• Payments for the same amount on a regular schedule, such as weekly or monthly service fees
(cleaning, day‐care, etc.).
• Payments for a different amount on a regular schedule, such as utility bills and country club greens and
other usage fees.
• Payment plans for discharging a large debt, such as car loan payments and layaway payments.
How to Authorize:
1. Have your customer sign and date a form (see templates below) that includes the bank account to be
charged, how to terminate the schedule, and the information specified below for the type of recurring
payment schedule:
  a. Payments for the same amount on a regular schedule:  Amount, frequency, and start date.
  b. Payments for a different (variable) amount on a regular schedule: Frequency, start date, not to
exceed amount.
  c. Payment plans for discharging a large debt: Total due, # of payments, amount of payment, frequency,
start date.
2. Give your customer a copy of the signed form.
3. Keep this form on file, stored digitally or in paper form, for two years after the last payment on the
schedule.
4. Send a receipt via mail or email for each transaction processed as part of the schedule.
What ADP Payments Does For You:
When you check the “Send a receipt to the customer” checkbox in the TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section of the
Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen, the system will automatically send all
required emails to your customers (step 4 above).
Templates Provided:
• ACH Recurring Payment Authorization Form‐Open‐‐
Use this form to authorize the SAME amount each time with an OPEN end date.
• ACH Recurring Payment Authorization Form‐SET
Use this form to authorize the SAME amount each time with a SET end date.
• ACH Recurring Payment Authorization Form‐Variable
Use this form to authorize a DIFFERENT amount each time, with an OPEN end date.
• ACH Payment Plan Authorization Form
Use this form to authorize a SET number of payments of the SAME amount each time.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 539
TEL TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION GUIDE
TEL transactions are by definition those that are authorized over the telephone granting a business permission to
debit a consumer's personal checking or savings account.   NACHA permits these transactions if the customer
initiates the call, or if the merchant initiates the call and there is a pre‐existing relationship between the customer
and the merchant (a contract in place, or the customer has done business with the merchant in the last 2 years).
TEL transactions are used when a merchant obtains the bank account information and permission to charge the
account from a customer over the phone, and types it into a ADP Payments collect new payment screen for
processing.
One-time TEL Transaction Authorizations
Typical Uses: Phone order of goods and services, or for bill payments made via phone. For example:
• Purchasing an item from a catalog.
• Paying a utility bill received via mail or email.
• Making a deposit on goods or services to be delivered/performed at a later date.
• Making a charitable donation.
How to Authorize: There are two ways to authorize a TEL transaction, which may be used together or separately.
• Voice Recording
• Notify the caller that the call is being recorded.
• Clearly state the particulars of the transaction‐‐ Use the following as a template:
I want to confirm that today {insert current date} you are authorizing {insert your company name}
to initiate a one‐time ACH debit from your bank account for {amount} on {date}. If you have any
questions about this debit you can reach us at {insert your business phone number}. Please say “I
agree” to authorize this transaction.
• Make certain that you hear the customer say “I Agree.”  Silence does not constitute authorization.
• Send an email receipt as described below. (Optional)
• Save the tape of the authorization for at least 90 days and up to 2 years (if you don't send a
receipt).
• Email, Mail, or Fax Confirmation (you must prove the confirmation was sent, you're not required to
prove it was received.)
• Send an email, fax, or mailed confirmation BEFORE the transaction is submitted to the bank
Note: Automated email receipts from ADP Payments ALWAYS get sent before the transaction is
submitted to the bank.
• Make sure the email contains the customer's name, the last 4 digits of the bank account number,
the transaction amount, the date it was authorized, the date it will be processed, and a number
where the customer can contact you. The default TEL receipt in ADP Payments contains all of the
required elements.
• Keep a copy of the receipt on file (for emails, CC or BCC to your email address) for 2 years.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 540
What ADP Payments Does For You:
When you check the “Send a receipt to the customer” checkbox in the TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section of the
Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen, ADP Payments automatically sends receipts
for ACH TEL transactions to the address entered in the Email field for the Customer Record. When you check the
“Send a receipt to my company at” checkbox and enter your email address in the field, in the TRANSACTION
RECEIPTS section of the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen, ADP Payments
automatically sends a CC of the receipt email to the email address you entered.
Recurring TEL Transaction Authorizations
NACHA regulations were changed in September 2011 to permit authorizing recurring transactions over the phone
using the TEL code, however ADP Payments ACH processors do not yet support this functionality. You cannot
currently accept verbal authorization for a recurring transaction‐‐ You must obtain written authorization or
authorization via a form on the Internet for any recurring transactions.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 541
ONE-TIME WEB TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION GUIDE
WEB transactions are by definition those that are authorized by a consumer entering payment information into a
web form, actively checking a box to agree to the terms and conditions for the transaction (pre‐checked boxes are
not allowed), and clicking a “Submit” button.
Typical Uses: Online orders for good or services, or online bill payments.  For example:
• Purchasing an item from an online store.
• Ordering an e‐book.
• Paying rent.
• Making a charitable donation.
How to Authorize:  
1. Include NACHA mandated language in the terms and conditions section.
2. Enable your customer to view and print a receipt after the payment has been successfully submitted.
3. Email a receipt to your customer, CC yourself, and keep a copy of the email for 2 years.
What ADP Payments Does for You:
The Web Payment Pages you create as part of your ADP Payments system automate most of the authorization steps
for you, including displaying terms and conditions on your payment forms and online invoice payment forms,
automatically generating a transaction confirmation page and automatically emailing a receipt. To complete the
process, you need to complete the steps indicated below for invoice payments and web payment pages.
Online Payment of ADP Payments Invoices
1. In the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Preferences screen be certain to:
  a. Check the box for include phone number‐‐ Make sure to use one that is answered during regular
business hours.
  b. Check the box to include Email address‐‐ Make sure to use one that is monitored during regular
business hours.
  c. Check the box to include website (if you have one).
2. In the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Payment Notification/Options‐‐> Invoice Settings section enter
language in Enter your Terms of Sale here field that includes language required for a one‐time Echeck
(ACH) WEB payment. (See Sample Language for Authorizing One‐time ACH WEB Transactions below.)
3. Make sure that your customer gets a receipt for all payments, and that your company gets a copy of the
receipt. To do this, in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen in the
TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section, check the “Send a receipt to the customer” checkbox and check the
“Send a receipt to my company at” checkbox and enter your email address in the field.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 542
Web Payment Pages for One-time Payments
1. When creating a new Web Payment Page (see Add a Web Payment Page in Chapter 8) be certain to:
  a. Include all required language for authorizing online Echeck (ACH) transactions in the Terms and
Conditions field. (See Sample Language for Authorizing One‐time ACH WEB Transactions below.)
  b. Be certain to complete the Contact Information section with current contact information for your
company.  The phone number and email address provided must be monitored and answered during
regular business hours.
2. Make sure that your customer gets a receipt for all payments, and that your company gets a copy of the
receipt. To do this, in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen, check the
“Send a receipt to the customer” checkbox in the TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section, check the “Send a
receipt to the customer” checkbox and check the “Send a receipt to my company at” checkbox and enter
your email address in the field.
Should your customer ever request a copy of the receipt from an online transaction, you can print a copy or email a
copy using the “Print” or “Email” links in the Actions drop‐down box for that transaction in the Payments table.
Sample Language for Authorizing One-time ACH WEB Transactions
When configuring your Web Payment Page add the following text to the Terms and Conditions field. When entering
Terms of Sale for your invoices include the following text. Be sure to use this text in addition to your company’s
standard terms and conditions for both fields.
Enter your business information in place of the red insert indicators.
I authorize {insert company name} to debit the bank account indicated in this web form, for the noted
amount on today’s date. I understand that because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may
be withdrawn from my account as soon as the above noted transaction date. In the case of an ACH
Transaction being rejected for Non Sufficient Funds (NSF) I understand that the business may at its
discretion attempt to process the charge again within 30 days, and agree to an additional {insert $}
charge for each attempt returned NSF which will be initiated as a separate transaction from the
authorized recurring payment. I acknowledge that the origination of ACH transactions to my account
must comply with the provisions of U.S. law. I will not dispute merchant debiting my checking/savings
account, so long as the transaction corresponds to the terms indicated in this web form.
NOTE: If you do not want to charge a NSF fee, you can delete this portion of the sample text.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 543
RECURRING WEB TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION GUIDE
Recurring WEB transactions are by definition those that are authorized by a consumer entering payment
information into a web form along with details about the schedule amount and frequency, actively checking a box to
agree to the terms and conditions for the schedule (pre‐checked boxes are not allowed), and clicking a “Submit”
button.
Typical Uses: ADP Payments Web Payment Pages support two types of recurring transactions:
• Recurring Billing for the same amount on a regular schedule, such as weekly service fees or monthly
charitable donations.
• Payment Plans for discharging a large debt, such as car loan payments or installment payments on a
large purchase.
How to Authorize:
1. Include NACHA mandated language in the Terms and Conditions field.
2. Enable your customer to view and print a receipt immediately after submitting the payment form that
contains:
  a. Full details of the schedule (payment amount, frequency, start date, end date or # of payments).
  b. A confirmation # for any transaction processed as part of the schedule when it was entered.
3. Email a receipt to your customer for each transaction processed as part of the schedule, CC yourself, and
keep a copy of the email for 2 years.
4. Notify your customer in advance of any change to the schedule payment amount (or payment range) or
frequency.
What ADP Payments Does for You:
The Web Payment Pages you create as part of your ADP Payments system automate most of the authorization steps
for you, including displaying terms and conditions on your payment form, automatically generating a transaction
confirmation page and automatically emailing a receipt. To complete the process, you need to do the following:
• When creating a new Web Payment Page (see Add a Web Payment Page in Chapter 8) be certain to
include all required language for authorizing online Echeck (ACH) transactions in the Terms and
Conditions field. (See Sample Language for Authorizing Recurring ACH WEB Transactions below.)
• Be certain to complete the Contact Information section of the Web Payment Page with current contact
information for your company. The phone number and email address provided must be monitored and
answered during regular business hours.
• Make sure that your customer gets a receipt for all payments, and that your company gets a copy of
the receipt. To do this, in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email Preferences and Templates screen,
check the “Send a receipt to the customer” checkbox in the TRANSACTION RECEIPTS section, check
the “Send a receipt to the customer” checkbox and check the “Send a receipt to my company at”
checkbox and enter your email address in the field.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 544
• Make certain that you send new schedule notifications to your customers and that you keep copies. To
do this, in the RECURRING PAYMENT REMINDERS section of the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Email
Preferences and Templatesscreen, for the “Do you want to send emailsfor new and updated recurring
payment schedules?” question, check the “Send notification to the customer” check box and the
“Send notification to my company at” checkbox and enter your email address in the field. (See Email
Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8 for instructions on how to edit email templates.)
Should your customer ever request a copy of the recurring schedule details you can print a copy by clicking the
linked Payment# in the Recurring Payments table and then using your web browser’s print function. (If you want to
email the schedule details, print to .pdf and email the file to your customer.) To re‐send a receipt from an
automatically generated transaction, you can print a copy or email a copy using the “Print” or “Email” links in the
Actions drop‐down box for that transaction in the Payments table.
Sample Language for Authorizing Recurring ACH WEB Transactions
When configuring your Web Payment Page, add the following text to the Terms and Conditions field, in addition to
your company’s standard terms and conditions.
Enter your business information in place of the red insert indicators.
I authorize {company name} to debit the bank account indicated in this web form, for the noted
amount on the schedule indicated. I understand that this authorization will remain in effect until the
schedule end date, or until I cancel it in writing, which ever comes first, and I agree to notify the
business in writing of any changes in my account information or termination of this authorization at
least 15 days prior to the next billing date. If the above noted payment date falls on a weekend or
holiday, I understand that the payment may be executed on the next business day. I understand that
because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from my account each
period as soon as the above noted transaction date. In the case of an ACH Transaction being rejected
for Non Sufficient Funds (NSF) I understand that the business may at its discretion attempt to process
the charge again within 30 days, and agree to an additional {insert $} charge for each attempt
returned NSF which will be initiated as a separate transaction from the authorized recurring
payment. I acknowledge that the origination of ACH transactions to my account must comply with
the provisions of U.S. law. I will not dispute the company’s recurring billing with my bank so long as
the transaction corresponds to the terms indicated in this agreement.
NOTE: If you do not want to charge a NSF fee, you can delete this portion of the sample text.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 545
CCD TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION GUIDE
The CCD transaction type is used for permitting electronic debits between businesses. (Paper checks cannot be
processed using the CCD code.) The major difference between CCD transactions and Business to Consumer
transactions is the amount of time after the transaction in which it can be disputed. For the Business to Consumer
codes (PPD, TEL, and WEB) the customer has 60 days to dispute. For CCD it is only 3 days. Thus, if you are billing
another business, it is to your advantage to enter the transaction as CCD.
How to Authorize: To use the CCD code you must have a signed agreement in place with your business‐to‐business
(B2B) customer stating that it agrees to allow you to debit its account. This can be a separate overriding agreement
covering all transactions for one or more bank accounts, or it can be included in a one‐time or recurring ACH
authorization. It can also be included in terms and conditions of any contract you have with your B2B customer.
1. Use Overriding Agreement
  a. Have your B2B customer sign the overriding ACH Authorization (template below) or include similar
language in the terms and conditions of your contract.
  b. One‐time transactions or recurring schedules can be authorized in writing, by phone, fax, or email.
  c. Keep a copy of the agreement and authorizations for 2 years after the last transaction is processed.
2. One‐time Written Authorization
  a. Have your B2B customer sign and date a transaction authorization (template below) or include similar
language in the terms and conditions of your contract that indicates:
• Payment amount and date.
• Bank information for account to be debited.
• Statement that bank account is enabled for ACH.
• Agreement to be bound by NACHA operating rules.
  b. Keep a copy of the authorization for 2 years.
3. Recurring Schedule Written Authorization
  a. Have your B2B customer sign and date a transaction authorization (template below) or include similar
language in the terms and conditions of your contract that indicates:
• Payment amount and frequency.
• Bank information for account to be debited.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Many business bank accounts have ACH capability disabled; thus to
avoid return and chargeback fees it is essential that you confirm with your customer
that its business bank account is enabled for ACH.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 546
• Statement that bank account is enabled for ACH.
• Agreement to be bound by NACHA operating rules.
  b. Keep a copy of the authorization for 2 years after the last payment on the schedule.
Templates Provided:
• Overriding CCD ACH Authorization‐One Account
Use this authorization form to establish an ACH agreement with your B2B customer for one bank
account.
• Overriding CCD ACH Authorization‐Two Accounts
Use this authorization form to establish an ACH agreement with your B2B customer for two bank
accounts.
• One‐time CCD Payment Authorization Form
Use this form to authorize a ONE‐Time transaction.
• Recurring Billing Schedule CCD Authorization Form
Use this form to authorize the SAME recurring amount with an OPEN end date.
• Recurring Billing Schedule CCD Authorization Form‐Variable
Use this form to authorize a DIFFERENT recurring amount with an OPEN end date.
• Payment Plan Schedule CCD Authorization Form
Use this form to authorize a SET number of payments of the SAME amount each time.
If you don't have a written agreement with the company for CCD, you can process one‐time telephone transactions
using the TEL code (See TEL Transaction Authorization Guide above), or one‐time and recurring Internet transactions
using the WEB code (See One‐time WEB Transaction Authorization Guide and Recurring WEB Transaction
Authorization Guide.)‐‐Just be sure you have confirmed that the bank account has been enabled for ACH. If you do
this, the business will have the same 60 days to dispute the charge as a consumer would.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 547
ACH CHARGEBACKS
ACH Chargebacks are defined as those that were improperly authorized or improperly executed based on the
authorization received. Four ACH Return Codes (R05, R07, R10 and R29) are considered chargebacks. (See ACH
Chargeback Return Codes in Appendix for details on Chargeback Return Codes.)
Unfortunately, once a chargeback return code has been issued there is no dispute process within the ACH system
that can be used to reverse it. Thus, it is important that as a merchant accepting ACH transactions you do everything
you can to prevent them.
The first step in preventing ACH chargebacks is to understand their most common causes, and the second is to take
steps to address them as part of your standard business practices.
The following are some suggestions on what to expect and what you can do.
Most Common Causes of ACH Chargebacks
ACH chargebacks fall into two basic categories‐‐ transactions rejected by the banks directly and transactions
disputed by your customers.
Two ACH Return Codes are used for transactions rejected by the banks directly:
• R05: This return code is used when you process a transaction against a consumer checking or savings
account using the CCD ACH type code. (See Appendix B: R05 Unauthorized Debit to Consumer Account
Using Corporate SEC Code).
NOTE: In most cases the bank will reject this transaction without your customer’s knowledge.
• R29: This return code is used when you attempt to charge a business checking account for which ACH
transactions are not enabled. (See Appendix B: R29 Corporate Customer Advises Not Authorized.)
NOTE: This code is also used when a business customer disputes a CCD transaction. When it is used to
reject all ACH transactions because of account set‐up, your customer may not know that the bank has
rejected the transaction.
All other ACH returns are a result of your customer taking action to dispute a charge or to remove your authorization
to debit their bank accounts. However, unlike with credit card transactions, the reasons that a customer can use to
dispute an ACH transaction are very limited. In fact, there are only three permissible reasons to dispute an ACH
debit:
1. The transaction was never authorized or the authorization was revoked.
2. The amount debited was not the authorized amount.
NOTE: You must process the payment for the EXACT amount authorized‐‐ amounts higher or lower are
grounds for a chargeback.
3. The transaction was executed BEFORE the authorized date (Any date after the authorized date is not
grounds for a chargeback.)
ACH Return Codes R10 (for consumer accounts) and R29 (for business accounts) will be used when a customer
claimsthat a transaction was not properly authorized for one of the above reasons. For revoked authorizations (such
as a revoked recurring payment authorization) ACH Return Code R07 will be used.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 548
The following are some common things that cause customers to dispute ACH transactions:
• The customer does not recognize the charge.
• The customer does not remember authorizing the charge.
• A spouse or other joint account holder does not know the charge was authorized.
• You make a data entry error on amount, transaction date, or account number.
• You split a single authorized amount into two smaller transactions  (For example, you are authorized to
make a single $100 charge, and instead you process two  $50 charges.)
• You enter the wrong ACH Type for the transaction. (For example, processing a paper check as PPD)
• You attempt an ACH transaction on a business bank account not configured for ACH.
• The customer revokes your permission to debit his account but only tells the bank and does not also
notify you.
• The customer lies to the bank about the authorization.
What You Can Do to Prevent ACH Chargebacks
Unfortunately there is no remedy within the ACH system itself to dispute chargebacks, even if you've done
everything right.   Once your customer has disputed the charge with the bank, your only recourse is to take your
customer to court and prove to a judge that you actually did have proper authorization to debit the account. While
you are likely to prevail if you have proof of authorization, going to court is never fun‐‐to say nothing of the time and
money it will cost you. In most cases merchants simply decide to absorb the loss and move on.
Thus, your best course of action is to do everything possible to prevent Chargebacks, so you'll never have to worry
about remedying them. The following are some suggestions for steps you can take to address and prevent
chargebacks as part of your standard business practices.
• Follow all the ACH Transaction authorization rules outlined in this Appendix to properly authorize all
one time and recurring transactions, and use the correct ACH Type for each transaction.
• Tell your customers how the ACH debit will appear on their bank statements.  For most electronic
debits, it will say "ACH DEBIT" followed by your company name.  In some cases it will also include the
name of the person who authorized the debit.
• Make sure your customer remembers the authorization and the details of the authorized charge‐this is
particularly important when debits are part of a recurring payment schedule.  Steps you can take:
• Always send a receipt for transactions. (ADP Payments can do this for you automatically with a
single setting‐‐ see Email Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8.)
• Always send a pre‐notification email in advance of transactions that are part of recurring billing
schedules. (ADP Payments can do this for you automatically with a single setting‐‐ see Email
Preferences and Templates in Chapter 8.)
• Always provide a copy of recurring billing authorizations to your customers
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions 549
• Always notify customers of any change in a recurring billing schedule (ADP Payments does this
automatically.)
• Remind your customers to tell joint account owners about the authorized charges
• Make certain that your business customers confirm that their accounts are enabled for ACH
transactions before you initiate any debits against them. You can also include in your contract language
that your business customer is responsible for reimbursing you for all fees incurred if a transaction you
initiate is returned as a chargeback because the account turns out not to be ACH enabled. (See CCD
Transaction Authorization Guide.)
• Encourage your customers to call you first if they have any questions about a charge.  Institute a
reasonable refund policy and quickly acknowledge and remedy any errors you may have made.
Remember, once the customer disputes the charge with the bank, there is nothing you
can do to reverse the chargeback.
So as with most business matters, maintaining good customer relationships is the
single most important thing you can do to protect yourself.  If customers call you first,
you can refresh their memory about authorizations, or if a mistake was made you can
correct it.  Even if you end up refunding a transaction that you think is valid, it's a smart
move to do it yourself before the bank gets involved.  Taking preemptive action will
save you chargeback fees, protect your processing record, and hopefully enhance
customer satisfaction.
Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions : Authorization Templates Including Both ACH and Credit Card Payment Options 550
Authorization Templates Including Both ACH and
Credit Card Payment Options
ADP Payments supports one‐time payments and recurring schedules for both Echeck (ACH) and credit card
transactions. As there are many similarities between authorizations for credit card and ACH transactions, you can
typically use a single form to cover both types.
Templates for authorizations that include the option to pay by either Echeck (ACH) or credit card are provided below.
ONE-TIME PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION TEMPLATES-- ACH & CC PAYMENT
OPTIONS
ACH transactions authorized via this form should be entered as PPD.
Template Provided:
• One‐time Payment Authorization Form‐‐ ACH or Credit Card
Use this form to authorize a single one‐time payment.
RECURRING SCHEDULE AUTHORIZATION TEMPLATES-- ACH & CC
PAYMENT OPTIONS:
ACH transactions authorized via these forms should be entered as PPD.

Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions 551
ONLINE PAYMENT FORMS-- ACH & CC PAYMENT OPTIONS
When you configure an online payment form, using ADP Payments Web Payment Pages (See Web Payment Pages in
Chapter 8) you need to include Terms and Conditions text as part of the form creation process.
Additionally, in the Settings‐‐> Configuration‐‐> Invoice Settings section, you need to enter Terms of Sale that will
govern the invoice payment. (See Invoice Settings in Chapter 8.) These terms of sale will be displayed to your
customers when they pay your invoices online.
If you are accepting both credit card and Echeck (ACH) payments, both these areasfor entering terms and conditions
must contain authorization language that meets the requirements for both payment types.  Sample language is
provided below.
Sample Language for Authorizing One-time Online Credit Card and ACH Transactions
When configuring your Web Payment Page add the following text to the Terms and Conditionsfield.  When entering
Terms of Sale for your invoices include the following text.  Be sure to use this text in addition to your company’s
standard terms and conditions for both fields.  Enter your business information in place of the red insert indicators.
I authorize {insert company name} to debit the bank account or credit card indicated in this web form,
for the noted amount on today’s date. This payment is for {insert description of goods/services}. I
understand that returns, refunds and cancellations are {insert your policy here}. I understand that
because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from my account as soon as
the above noted transaction date. In the case of an ACH Transaction being rejected for Non Sufficient
Funds (NSF) I understand that the business may at its discretion attempt to process the charge again
within 30 days, and agree to an additional {insert $} charge for each attempt returned NSF, which will
be initiated as a separate transaction from the authorized payment. I acknowledge that the
origination of ACH transactions to my account must comply with the provisions of U.S. law. I certify
that I am an authorized user of this credit card or bank account, and that I will not dispute the
payment with my Credit Card Company or Bank, so long as the transaction corresponds to the terms
indicated in this web form.
NOTE: If you do not want to charge a NSF fee, you can delete this portion of the sample text.

Appendix B: ACH Return Codes 552
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes
When an Echeck (ACH) transaction processed via your ADP Payments system is returned, you will see its status
marked as “Returned” in any transaction table or report. When you view transaction details, you will see an ACH
reason code in the Reason Description field, along with the short description for that code.
There are two classifications of ACH Return codes‐‐ regular returns, and returns of unauthorized transactions. Most
ACH Returns fall into the “regular” category, and they typically will not impact your ability to continue processing.
Excessive “unauthorized” ACH Returns, also called “chargebacks,” can result in constraints being placed on your ACH
processing, or even suspension or termination of your ACH processing privileges. (See ACH Chargeback Return
Codes for more information on “unauthorized” ACH Return Codes.)
The following things happen when an ACH Transaction is “Returned:”
• The full amount of that transaction is withdrawn from your bank account immediately
• For “regular” ACH Return Codes, you are assessed the ACH Return Fee as noted in your ACH Processing
contract, which will be billed as part of your regular monthly transaction processing fees.
• For “unauthorized” ACH Return Codes, you are assessed the ACH Chargeback Fee as noted in your ACH
ACH Processing contract, which will be billed as part of your regular monthly transaction processing
fees.
Note that some ACH Returns are not immediate, and it is very possible that a transaction that initially contains a
status of “Settled” will later be changed to “Returned” or to “Chargeback.” This is particularly common with
“unauthorized” ACH Returns, because your customers have up to 60 days after a transaction appears on their bank
statement to inform the bank that a transaction was not authorized.
The following sections provide detailed explanations for all ACH Return Codes, along with instructions on what you
should do next to correct problems and re‐submit transactions.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Most Common ACH Return Codes 553
Most Common ACH Return Codes
The Return Codes and NACHA Definitions included below are all quoted directly from 2009 ACH Rules: A Complete Guide To Rules & Regulations Governing the ACH
Network (National Automated Clearing House Association, 2009)
The following “regular” ACH Return Codes are the ones you are most likely to encounter in the course of normal
payment processing. See Directory of ACH Return Codes below, for a complete list of return codes applicable to your
ADP Payments ACH processing account.
R01 Insufficient Funds
R02 Account Closed
NACHA Description: The available and/or cash reserve balance is not sufficient to cover the dollar value of
the debit entry.
What it Means: There were insufficient funds in your customer’s account to complete the
transaction. You will see this type of ACH Return displayed in ADP Payments with a
status of “Returned NSF” and a Reason Description of “Non Sufficient Funds” or
“NSF.”
What to Do: You can also direct the bank to automatically re‐submit transactions returned for
insufficient funds. This setting is attached to your ACH Processing Account, and is not
included in your ADP Payments system settings. If your account was not initially
configured for an automatic re‐submit, please contact Customer Care so that we can
make the appropriate adjustment with your ACH processor. Note that if you
configure automatic re‐submit, you run the risk of the transaction being returned
again, and incurring a second ACH Return fee.
You can also contact your customer for a different form of payment, or ask them for a
date when the account will contain funds so that you can manually submit the
transaction again.
If you have not yet shipped the goods or provided the services covered by the
payment, you may want to wait to do so until you have confirmation of a settled
payment.
NACHA Definition: A previously active account has been closed by action of the customer or the RDFI.
What it Means: The bank account you attempted to charge is closed, and you cannot re‐submit this
transaction.
What to Do: Contact your customer for a different bank account, or for another form of payment.
If you have not yet shipped the goods or provided the services covered by the
payment, you may want to wait to do so until you have confirmation of a settled
payment.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Most Common ACH Return Codes 554
R03 No Account/Unable to Locate Account
R04 Invalid Account Number
R20 Non‐Transaction Account  
NACHA Definition: The account number structure is valid and it passes the check digit validation, but the
account number does not correspond to the individual identified in the entry, or the
account number designated is not an existing account
What it Means: When entering the transaction, the Routing Number, Bank Account Number, and/or
the Customer Name was entered incorrectly.  You cannot re‐submit this transaction.
What to Do: Contact your customer and confirm the Routing Number, Bank Account Number and
the exact name on the bank account. (You may want to ask your customer to fax a
copy of a voided check so that you can double‐check these values yourself.)
If this information does not exactly match what you initially entered, make changes
and submit a NEW payment.
If you did enter everything correctly, please contact Customer Care so that we can
further investigate the problem.
NACHA Definition: The account number structure is not valid. The entry may fail the check digit
validation or may contain an incorrect number of digits.
What it Means: When entering the transaction, the Bank Account Number entered was definitely
wrong.  You cannot re‐submit this transaction.
What to Do: Contact your customer and obtain the correct bank account number. (You may want
to ask your customer to fax a copy of a voided check so that you can double‐check the
bank account number yourself.)
Submit a NEW payment using the corrected bank account number.
NACHA Definition: The ACH entry destined for a non‐transaction account, as defined in Regulation D,
would include either an account against which transactions are prohibited or limited
or a pass‐through where the entry is for a credit union or thrift organization and
Regulation E descriptive requirements cannot be met.
What it Means: The bank account you entered cannot be used for ACH Payments.
What to Do: Contact your customer to obtain authorization to charge a different bank account.
(Be certain that your customer confirmsthe account is enabled for ACH transactions.)
Or, ask for a different form of payment.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : ACH Chargeback Return Codes 555
ACH Chargeback Return Codes
If a consumer transaction (ACH Types: PPD, TEL, WEB) is returned with an ACH Chargeback Code (R05, R07, R10), it
means that the consumer has presented a signed statement (or the electronic equivalent) to the bank stating that
one or more of the following is the case:
• The transaction was never authorized by the account holder or authorization was revoked;
• The transaction was processed on a date earlier than authorized; or
• The transaction is for an amount different than authorized.
NOTE: The transaction must be for the exact amount authorized‐‐ it cannot be higher or lower.  
For a business transaction using the CCD ACH Type (against a business checking account), ACH Chargeback code R29
is used if the account itself is not enabled for ACH Transactions, or if the account holder notifies the bank that the
transaction was not authorized.
As part of the ACH Chargeback process, your customer’s bank will place a block on the account so that any further
attempts by your company to debit that bank account will be rejected. Your customer must contact the bank to
remove the block, and you should not attempt to process any further transactions against that account until you
have confirmed that the block has been removed, and you have notified ADP Payments Customer Care that the
block has been removed.
Unfortunately, there is no dispute resolution available to you within the ACH Network. If your customer continues to
claim the transaction was not authorized, but you have proof that it was properly authorized, you will need to sue
your customer in Small Claims Court to collect. If you decide to take this course of action, please contact ADP
Payments Customer Care to obtain a copy of the statement your customersubmitted to the bank‐‐ you will need this
document to pursue your case.
Your ACH processor, your bank, and NACHA take unauthorized transactions very
seriously. Your account is monitored for chargeback activity, and if such activity
becomes excessive your ACH processing privileges may be curtailed or suspended. ADP
Payments will make every attempt to contact you if your processing capability is in
peril and will help you make changesto bring your account back in‐line with acceptable
chargeback levels.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : ACH Chargeback Return Codes 556
The following are NACHA definitions of the 4 ACH Chargeback codes that apply to your account.
The Return Codes and NACHA Definitions included below are all quoted directly from 2009 ACH Rules: A Complete Guide To Rules & Regulations Governing the ACH
Network (National Automated Clearing House Association, 2009)
R05 Unauthorized Debit to Consumer Account Using Corporate SEC Code
NACHA Definition: A CCD, CTX, or CBR debit entry was transmitted to a Consumer Account of the Receiver
and was not authorized by the Receiver. [A CCD or CTX debit entry was transmitted to
a Consumer Account of the Receiver and was not authorized by the Receiver.] The
Receiver may request immediate credit from the RDFI for an unauthorized debit. The
request must be made in writing within fifteen (15) days after the RDFI sends or makes
available to the Receiver information pertaining to that debit entry. The Receiver must
also provide the RDFI with a written statement, pursuant to subsection 8.6.6
(Receiver's Written Statement), that the debit entry was not authorized by the
Receiver. For purposes of this code and related Operating Rules provisions, a debit
entry was not authorized by a Receiver if (1) the authorization requirements of Article
Two, subsection 2.1.2 (Receiver Authorization and Agreement) have not been met; (2)
the debit entry was initiated in an amount greater than that authorized by the
Receiver; or (3) the debit entry was initiated for settlement earlier than authorized by
the Receiver. An unauthorized debit entry does not include a debit entry initiated with
fraudulent intent by the Receiver or any person acting in concert with the Receiver. An
RDFI using this return reason code must transmit the return entry by its ACH
Operator's deposit deadline for the return entry to be made available to the ODFI no
later than the opening of business on the banking day following the sixtieth calendar
day following the Settlement Date of the original entry.
What it Means: An ACH Transaction entered as “CCD” was attempted against a consumer’s personal
bank account, and the consumer reported the transaction to the bank as not
authorized.
Ordinarily a “CCD” transaction has a 3‐day window in which the transaction can be
disputed, but this code directs the bank to honor the return if it is entered within 60
days of the original transaction. This is done because the transaction was incorrectly
coded as “CCD” when entered. “CCD” is used only when charging a business bank
account.
You cannot re‐submit this transaction. Any additional transactions you attempt to
process against this account will also be returned unless your customer specifically
instructs his bank to accept them.
WhattoDo: Contact your customer and resolve any issues that caused the transaction to be
disputed.
You can ask the customer for a different form of payment, or ask to debit a different
bank account.
If you need to debit the same bank account, instruct your customer to call the bank
and remove the block on transactions your company initiates. The contact ADP
Payments Customer Care and inform them that the block has been lifted. You will be
informed when it is permissible to re‐submit the transaction. When you do, be certain
to use the proper ACH Type for a personal bank account and NOT the “CCD” type.
(See Appendix A, Authorizing ACH Transactions for detailed information on ACH
Types.)
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : ACH Chargeback Return Codes 557
R07 Authorization Revoked by Customer
NACHA Definition: The RDFI's customer (the Receiver) has revoked the authorization previously provided
to the Originator for this particular transaction. The Receiver may request immediate
credit from the RDFI for an unauthorized debit. The request must be made in writing
within fifteen (15) days after the RDFI sends or makes available to the Receiver
information pertaining to that debit entry. The Receiver must also provide the RDFI
with a written statement that the authorization for the debit entry has been revoked
by the Receiver. The RDFI must return the rescinded transaction to its ACH Operator by
its deposit deadline for the adjustment entry to be made available to the ODFI no later
than the opening of business on the banking day following the sixtieth calendar day
following the Settlement Date of the original entry. This code and related Operating
Rule provisions apply to Consumer entries only. (Note: This Return Reason Code may
not be used for POP entries, Single‐Entry WEB entries, or TEL entries.)
What it Means: Your customer reported to the bank that the transaction was not authorized because
they revoked your authorization to process the payment prior to the transaction date.
This code can only be used on one‐time or recurring transactions processed against a
Consumer’s personal bank account with an ACH Type of PPD, or on a recurring
transaction with an ACH type of WEB.
Typically you will see this return code when a customer revokes authorization for a
recurring payment schedule, and you continue to process payments as part of that
payment.
You cannot re‐submit this transaction. Any additional transactions you attempt to
process against this account will also be returned unless your customer specifically
instructs his bank to accept them
WhattoDo: Immediately pause any recurring payment schedules entered for this bank account to
prevent additional transactions from being returned while you address the issue with
your customer.
Contact your customer and resolve any issues that caused the transaction to be
disputed or the schedule to be canceled.
You can ask the customer for a different form of payment, or ask to debit a different
bank account.   Be certain to get proper authorization from your customer to debit
the new account. (See Appendix A, Authorizing ACH Transactions for more
information on how to do this.)
If you need to debit the same bank account, instruct your customer to call the bank
and remove the block on transactions your company initiates. Then contact ADP
Payments Customer Care and inform them that the block has been lifted. You will be
informed when it is permissible to re‐submit the transaction.

R10 Customer Advises Not Authorized, Notice Not Provided, Improper Source Document, or Amount of
Entry Not Accurately Obtained from Source Document
NACHA Definition: For entries to Consumer Accounts that are not ARC, BOC, POP, or RCK entries, the RDFI
has been notified by its customer, the Receiver, that the Originator of a given
transaction has not been authorized to debit his account.....The Receiver may request
immediate credit from the RDFI for an unauthorized debit. The request must be made
in writing within fifteen (15) days after the RDFI sends or makes available to the
Receiver information pertaining to that debit entry. The Receiver must also provide
the RDFI with a written statement, pursuant to subsection 8.6.6 (Receiver's Written
Statement), that the debit entry was not authorized by the Receiver. For purposes of
this code and related Operating Rules provisions, a debit entry was not authorized by
the Receiver if (1) the authorization requirements of Article Two, subsection 2.1.2
(Receiver Authorization and Agreement) have not been met; (2) the debit entry was
initiated in an amount greater than that authorized by the Receiver; or (3) the debit
entry was initiated for settlement earlier than authorized by the Receiver. An
unauthorized debit entry does not include a debit entry initiated with fraudulent intent
by the Receiver or any person acting in concert with the Receiver. The RDFI must
return the rescinded transaction to its ACH Operator by its deposit deadline for the
adjustment entry to be made available to the ODFI no later than the opening of
business on the banking day following the sixtieth calendar day following the
Settlement Date of the original entry....OR for ARC and BOC entries, the RDFI has been
notified by its customer, the Receiver, that (1) the Receiver opted out of check
conversion, (2) the required notice was not provided by the Originator in accordance
with Article Three, subsection 3.7.1 (Notice Obligation) or subsection 3.8.1 (Notice
Obligation), (3) the source document used for the debit entry is improper pursuant to
subsection 3.7.2 (Source Documents) or subsection 3.8.2 (Source Documents), or (4)
the amount of the ARC or BOC entry was not accurately obtained from the source
document. The Receiver may request immediate credit from the RDFI for an ARC or
BOC entry for the reasons described above. The request must be made in writing
within fifteen (15) days after the RDFI sends or makes available to the Receiver
information relating to that debit entry. The Receiver must also provide the RDFI with
a written statement, pursuant to subsection 8.6.6.1 (Receiver's Written Statement for
ARC and BOC Entries), that (1) the Receiver optedout of check conversion, (2) the
required notice was not provided, (3) the source document used for the debit entry is
improper, or (4) the amount of the ARC or BOC entry was not accurately obtained from
the source document. An RDFI using this Return Reason Code must transmit the return
entry by its ACH Operator's deposit deadline for the return entry to be made available
to the ODFI no later than the opening of business on the banking day following the
sixtieth calendar day following the Settlement Date of the ARC or BOC entry...
What it Means: Your customer submitted a document to the bank stating that the transaction was not
authorized, or that the transaction was entered for an amount higher than the
authorized amount, or was submitted before the authorized date. (See Appendix A,
Authorizing ACH Transactions, for more information about authorization
requirements.)
You cannot re‐submit this transaction. Any additional transactions you attempt to
process against this account will also be returned unless your customer specifically
instructs his bank to accept them.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : ACH Chargeback Return Codes 559
WhattoDo: Immediately pause any recurring payment schedules entered for this bank account to
prevent additional transactions from being returned while you address the issue with
your customer.
Contact your customer and resolve any issues that caused the transaction to be
disputed.
You can ask the customer for a different form of payment, or ask to debit a different
bank account.   Be certain to get proper authorization from your customer to debit
the new account. (See Appendix A, Authorizing ACH Transactions for more
information on how to do this.)
If you need to debit the same bank account, instruct your customer to call the bank
and remove the block on transactions your company initiates. Then contact ADP
Payments Customer Care and inform them that the block has been lifted. You will be
informed when it is permissible to re‐submit the transaction.
R29 Corporate Customer Advises Not Authorized
NACHA Definition: The RDFI has been notified by the Receiver (non‐consumer) that a specific transaction
has not been authorized by the Receiver.
What it Means: The company you attempted to debit has notified the bank that the transaction was
not authorized. Or, you attempted to debit a business bank account that is not
enabled for ACH transactions.
You cannot re‐submit this transaction. Any additional transactions you attempt to
process against this account will also be returned unless your business customer
specifically instructs his bank to enable the account for ACH transactions.
WhattoDo: Immediately pause any recurring payment schedules entered for this bank account to
prevent additional transactions from being returned while you address the issue with
your customer.
Contact your customer and resolve any issues that caused them to claim the
transaction was unauthorized, then have your customer call the bank and remove the
block on transactions your company initiates. Or, if the problem is account
configuration, ask your customer to have the business bank account enabled for ACH
transactions. Then contact ADP Payments Customer Care and inform them that the
block has been lifted. You will be informed when it is permissible to re‐submit the
transaction.
Alternately, you can ask the customer for a different form of payment, or ask to debit
a different bank account.   Be certain to get proper authorization from your customer
to debit the new account. (See Appendix A, Authorizing ACH Transactions for more
information on how to do this.).
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 560
Directory of ACH Return Codes
The Return Codes and NACHA Definitions included below are all quoted directly from 2009 ACH Rules: A Complete Guide To Rules & Regulations Governing the ACH
Network (National Automated Clearing House Association, 2009)
The following ACH Return Codes can be associated with ACH payment processing. This is not a complete list of ACH
Return Codes‐‐ those related only to government payments, ATMs, ACH credits, paper check conversion, or inter‐
bank communications have been omitted.
R01 Insufficient Funds
NACHA Definition: The available and/or cash reserve balance is not sufficient to cover the dollar value of
the debit entry.
What it Means: There were insufficient funds in your customer’s account to complete the
transaction. You will see this type of ACH Return displayed in ADP Payments with a
status of “Returned NSF” and a Reason Description of “Non Sufficient Funds” or
“NSF.”
What to Do: You can direct the ACH processor to automatically re‐submit transactions returned
for insufficient funds. This setting is attached to your ACH Processing Account, and is
not included in your ADP Payments system settings. If your account was not initially
configured for an automatic re‐submit, please contact Customer Care so that we can
make the appropriate adjustment with your ACH processor. Note that if you configure
automatic re‐submit, you run the risk of the transaction being returned again, and
incurring a second ACH Return fee.
You can also contact your customer for a different form of payment, or ask them for a
date when the account will contain funds so that you can manually submit the
transaction again.
If you have not yet shipped the goods or provided the services covered by the
payment, you may want to wait to do so until you have confirmation of a settled
payment.
When you re‐submit a R01 or R09 (NSF) transaction you can only re‐submit for the
original transaction amount‐‐you CANNOT add in the ACH Return Fee assessed to your
company. If you want to collect this fee from your customers it must be authorized as a
SEPARATE ACH transaction and you must manually enter this transaction in ADP
Payments.
However, you are allowed to include the following statement in your Terms &
Conditions so that when your customers authorize the initial transaction, they also
authorize a second transaction to collect the ACH Return Fee in the case of a R01 or R09
(NSF) transaction.
In the case of an ACH Transaction being rejected for Non Sufficient Funds (NSF) I understand that
{your company name} may at its discretion attempt to process the charge again within 30 days, and
agree to an additional {insert $} charge for each attempt returned NSF which will be initiated as a
separate transaction from the initial authorized payment.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 561
R02 Account Closed
R03 No Account/Unable to Locate Account
R04 Invalid Account Number
NACHA Definition: A previously active account has been closed by action of the customer or the RDFI.
What it Means: The bank account you attempted to charge is closed, and you cannot re‐submit this
transaction.
What to Do: Contact your customer for a different bank account, or for another form of payment.
If you have not yet shipped the goods or provided the services covered by the
payment, you may want to wait to do so until you have confirmation of a settled
payment.
NACHA Definition: The account number structure is valid and it passes the check digit validation, but the
account number does not correspond to the individual identified in the entry, or the
account number designated is not an existing account.
What it Means: When entering the transaction, the Routing Number, Bank Account Number, and/or
the Customer Name was entered incorrectly.  You cannot re‐submit this transaction.
What to Do: Contact your customer and confirm the Routing Number, Bank Account Number and
the exact name on the bank account. (You may want to ask your customer to fax a
copy of a voided check so that you can double‐check these values yourself.)
If this information does not exactly match what you initially entered, make changes
and submit a NEW payment.
If you did enter everything correctly, please contact Customer Care so that we can
further investigate the problem.
NACHA Definition: The account number structure is not valid. The entry may fail the check digit
validation or may contain an incorrect number of digits.
What it Means: When entering the transaction, the Bank Account Number entered was definitely
wrong.  You cannot re‐submit this transaction.
What to Do: Contact your customer and obtain the correct bank account number. (You may want
to ask your customer to fax a copy of a voided check so that you can double‐check the
bank account number yourself.)
Submit a NEW payment using the corrected bank account number.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 562
R05 Unauthorized Debit to Consumer Account Using Corporate SEC Code
NACHA Definition: A CCD, CTX, or CBR debit entry was transmitted to a Consumer Account of the
Receiver and was not authorized by the Receiver. [A CCD or CTX debit entry was
transmitted to a Consumer Account of the Receiver and was not authorized by the
Receiver.] The Receiver may request immediate credit from the RDFI for an
unauthorized debit. The request must be made in writing within fifteen (15) days after
the RDFI sends or makes available to the Receiver information pertaining to that debit
entry. The Receiver must also provide the RDFI with a written statement, pursuant to
subsection 8.6.6 (Receiver's Written Statement), that the debit entry was not
authorized by the Receiver. For purposes of this code and related Operating Rules
provisions, a debit entry was not authorized by a Receiver if (1) the authorization
requirements of Article Two,subsection 2.1.2 (Receiver Authorization and Agreement)
have not been met; (2) the debit entry was initiated in an amount greater than that
authorized by the Receiver; or (3) the debit entry was initiated for settlement earlier
than authorized by the Receiver. An unauthorized debit entry does not include a debit
entry initiated with fraudulent intent by the Receiver or any person acting in concert
with the Receiver. An RDFI using this return reason code must transmit the return
entry by its ACH Operator's deposit deadline for the return entry to be made available
to the ODFI no later than the opening of business on the banking day following the
sixtieth calendar day following the Settlement Date of the original entry.
What it Means: An ACH Transaction entered as “CCD” was attempted against a consumer’s personal
bank account, and the consumer reported the transaction to the bank as not
authorized.
Ordinarily a “CCD” transaction has a 3‐day window in which the transaction can be
disputed, but this code directs the bank to honor the return if it is entered within 60
days of the original transaction. This is done because the transaction was incorrectly
coded as “CCD” when entered. “CCD” is used only when charging a business bank
account.
This is an “unauthorized” return code, and will result in your account being assessed
the ACH Chargeback Fee. (See ACH Chargeback Return Codes.)
You cannot re‐submit this transaction. Any additional transactions you attempt to
process against this account will also be returned unless your customer specifically
instructs his bank to accept them.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 563
R06 Returned per ODFI's Request
What to Do: Contact your customer and resolve any issues that caused the transaction to be
disputed.
You can ask the customer for a different form of payment, or ask to debit a different
bank account.
If you need to debit the same bank account, instruct your customer to call the bank
and remove the block on transactions your company initiates. Then contact ADP
Payments Customer Care and inform them that the block has been lifted. You will be
informed when it is permissible to re‐submit the transaction. When you do, be
certain to use the proper ACH Type for a personal bank account and NOT the “CCD”
type. (See Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions for detailed information on ACH
Types.)
Unfortunately, there is no dispute resolution available to you within the ACH
Network. If your customer continues to claim the transaction was not authorized, but
you have proof that it was properly authorized, you will need to sue your customer in
Small Claims Court to collect. If you decide to take this course of action, please
contact ADP Payments Customer Care to obtain a copy of the statement your
customer submitted to the bank‐‐ You will need this document to pursue your case.
NACHA Definition: The ODFI has requested that the RDFI return the ACH entry. If the RDFI agrees to
return the entry, the ODFI must indemnify the RDFI according to Article Eight (Recall,
Stop Payment, Recredit, and Adjustment) of these Rules.
What it Means: The bank that submitted a transaction on your behalf is asking your customer’s bank
to reverse it.  This typically happens if there is a technical problem during processing
that causes transactions to be submitted incorrectly.  In rare instances it can also
happen if the bank suspects it is being used to submit fraudulent transactions.  You
cannot re‐submit this transaction.
What to Do: Contact ADP Payments Customer Care to determine why the bank asked that the
payment be returned.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 564
R07 Authorization Revoked by Customer
NACHA Definition: The RDFI's customer (the Receiver) has revoked the authorization previously provided
to the Originator for this particular transaction. The Receiver may request immediate
credit from the RDFI for an unauthorized debit. The request must be made in writing
within fifteen (15) days after the RDFI sends or makes available to the Receiver
information pertaining to that debit entry. The Receiver must also provide the RDFI
with a written statement that the authorization for the debit entry has been revoked
by the Receiver. The RDFI must return the rescinded transaction to its ACH Operator
by its deposit deadline for the adjustment entry to be made available to the ODFI no
later than the opening of business on the banking day following the sixtieth calendar
day following the Settlement Date of the original entry. This code and related
Operating Rule provisions apply to Consumer entries only. (Note: This Return Reason
Code may not be used for POP entries, Single‐Entry WEB entries, or TEL entries.)
What it Means: Your customer reported to the bank that the transaction was not authorized because
they revoked your authorization prior to the transaction date.
This code can only be used on one‐time or recurring transactions processed against a
consumer’s personal bank account with an ACH Type of PPD, or on a recurring
transaction with an ACH type of WEB.
Typically you will see this return code when a customer revokes authorization for a
recurring payment schedule, and you continue to process payments as part of that
schedule.
This is an “unauthorized” return code, and will result in your account being assessed
the ACH Chargeback Fee. (See ACH Chargeback Return Codes for more information.)
You cannot re‐submit this transaction. Any additional transactions you attempt to
process against this account will also be returned unless your customer specifically
instructs his bank to accept them
What to Do: Immediately suspend any recurring payment schedules entered for this bank
account. This will prevent additional transactions from being returned while you
address the issue with your customer. Then contact your customer and resolve any
issues that caused the transaction to be disputed or the schedule to be cancelled.
You can ask the customer for a different form of payment, or ask to debit a different
bank account.   Be certain to get proper authorization from your customer to debit
the new account. (See Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions for more information
on how to do this.)
If you need to debit the same bank account, instruct your customer to call the bank
and remove the block on transactions your company initiates. Then contact ADP
Payments Customer Care and inform them that the block has been lifted. You will be
informed when it is permissible to re‐submit the transaction.
Unfortunately, there is no dispute resolution available to you within the ACH
Network. If your customer continues to claim the transaction was not authorized, but
you have proof that it was properly authorized, you will need to sue your customer in
Small Claims Court to collect. If you decide to take this course of action, please
contact ADP Payments Customer Care to obtain a copy of the statement your
customer submitted to the bank‐‐ you will need this document to pursue your case.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 565
R08 Payment Stopped  
R09 Uncollected Funds  
NACHA Definition: The Receiver of a debit transaction has the right to stop payment on any specific ACH
debit. A stop payment request should be handled in accordance with the provisions of
Article Eight (Recall, Stop Payment, Recredit, and Adjustment) of these Rules. The
RDFI should verify the Receiver's intent when a request for stop payment is made to
ensure this is not intended to be a revocation of authorization (R07). A stop payment
order shall remain in effect until the earliest of the following occurs: a lapse of six
months from the date of the stop payment order, payment of the debit entry has been
stopped, or the Receiver withdraws the stop payment order.
What it Means: Your customer instructed its bank not to honor a specific transaction they previously
authorized you to process. This instruction to the bank must be made BEFORE the
transaction is actually processed.
You cannot re‐submit this transaction, and your processor will reject all future
transactions against this account until you provide proof of a new authorization from
the customer.
What to Do: Contact your customer and resolve any issues that caused the transaction to be
stopped. To minimize the risk of additional returned transactions, it is a good idea to
make certain that your customer understands your billing procedures, and agrees not
to stop future payments.
You can re‐enter the returned transaction again with proper authorization from your
customer. You can also ask your customer for a different form of payment.
NACHA Definition: Sufficient book or ledger balance exists to satisfy the dollar value of the transaction, but
the dollar value of transactions in the process of collection (i.e., uncollected checks)
brings the available and/or cash reserve balance below the dollar value of the debit
entry.
What it Means: There were insufficient funds in your customer’s account to complete the transaction.
What to Do: You can direct the ACH processor to automatically re‐submit transactions returned for
insufficient funds. This setting is attached to your ACH Processing Account, and is not
included in your ADP Payments system settings. If your account was not initially
configured for an automatic re‐submit, please contact Customer Care so that we can
make the appropriate adjustment with your ACH processor. Note that if you configure
automatic re‐submit, you run the risk of the transaction being returned again, and
incurring a second ACH Return fee.
You can also contact your customer for a different form of payment, or ask them for a
date when the account will contain funds so that you can manually submit the
transaction again.
If you have not yet shipped the goods or provided the services covered by the payment,
you may want to wait to do so until you have confirmation of a settled payment.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 566
R10 Customer Advises Not Authorized, Notice Not Provided, Improper Source Document, or Amount of
Entry Not Accurately Obtained from Source Document  
NACHA Definition: For entries to Consumer Accounts that are not ARC, BOC, POP, or RCK entries, the RDFI
has been notified by its customer, the Receiver, that the Originator of a given
transaction has not been authorized to debit his account.....The Receiver may request
immediate credit from the RDFI for an unauthorized debit. The request must be made
in writing within fifteen (15) days after the RDFI sends or makes available to the
Receiver information pertaining to that debit entry. The Receiver must also provide
the RDFI with a written statement, pursuant to subsection 8.6.6 (Receiver's Written
Statement), that the debit entry was not authorized by the Receiver. For purposes of
this code and related Operating Rules provisions, a debit entry was not authorized by
the Receiver if (1) the authorization requirements of Article Two, subsection 2.1.2
(Receiver Authorization and Agreement) have not been met; (2) the debit entry was
initiated in an amount greater than that authorized by the Receiver; or (3) the debit
entry was initiated for settlement earlier than authorized by the Receiver. An
unauthorized debit entry does not include a debit entry initiated with fraudulent
intent by the Receiver or any person acting in concert with the Receiver. The RDFI
must return the rescinded transaction to its ACH Operator by its deposit deadline for
the adjustment entry to be made available to the ODFI no later than the opening of
business on the banking day following the sixtieth calendar day following the
Settlement Date of the original entry....OR for ARC and BOC entries, the RDFI has been
notified by its customer, the Receiver, that (1) the Receiver opted out of check
conversion, (2) the required notice was not provided by the Originator in accordance
with Article Three, subsection 3.7.1 (Notice Obligation) or subsection 3.8.1 (Notice
Obligation), (3) the source document used for the debit entry is improper pursuant to
subsection 3.7.2 (Source Documents) or subsection 3.8.2 (Source Documents), or (4)
the amount of the ARC or BOC entry was not accurately obtained from the source
document. The Receiver may request immediate credit from the RDFI for an ARC or
BOC entry for the reasons described above. The request must be made in writing
within fifteen (15) days after the RDFI sends or makes available to the Receiver
information relating to that debit entry. The Receiver must also provide the RDFI with
a written statement, pursuant to subsection 8.6.6.1 (Receiver's Written Statement for
ARC and BOC Entries), that (1) the Receiver optedout of check conversion, (2) the
required notice was not provided, (3) the source document used for the debit entry is
improper, or (4) the amount of the ARC or BOC entry was not accurately obtained
from the source document. An RDFI using this Return Reason Code must transmit the
return entry by its ACH Operator's deposit deadline for the return entry to be made
available to the ODFI no later than the opening of business on the banking day
following the sixtieth calendar day following the Settlement Date of the ARC or BOC
entry...
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 567
R12 Account Sold to Another DFI  
What it Means: Your customer submitted a signed document to the bank stating that the transaction
was not authorized, or that the transaction was entered for an amount different than
the authorized amount, or was submitted before the authorized date. (See
Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions for more information about authorization
requirements.)
This is an “unauthorized” return code, and will result in your account being assessed
the ACH Chargeback Fee. (See ACH Chargeback Return Codes for more information.)
You cannot re‐submit this transaction. Any additional transactions you attempt to
process against this account will also be returned unless your customer specifically
instructs his bank to accept them.
What to Do: Immediately suspend any recurring payment schedules entered for this bank
account. This will prevent additional transactions from being returned while you
address the issue with your customer.
Contact your customer and resolve any issues that caused the transaction to be
disputed.
You can ask the customer for a different form of payment, or ask to debit a different
bank account.   Be certain to get proper authorization from your customer to debit
the new account. (See Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions) for more information
on how to do this.)
If you need to debit the same bank account, instruct your customer to call the bank
and remove the block on transactions your company initiates. Then contact ADP
Payments Customer Care and inform them that the block has been lifted. You will be
informed when it is permissible to re‐submit the transaction.
Unfortunately, there is no dispute resolution available to you within the ACH
Network. If your customer continues to claim the transaction was not authorized, but
you have proof that it was properly authorized, you will need to sue your customer in
Small Claims Court to collect. If you decide to take this course of action, please
contact ADP Payments Customer Care to obtain a copy of the statement your
customer submitted to the bank‐‐ you will need this document to pursue your case.
NACHA Definition: A financial institution may continue to receive entries destined for an account that has
been sold to another financial institution. Because the RDFI no longer maintains the
account and is unable to post the entry, it should return the entry to the ODFI.
What it Means: Your customer’s account was sold to another bank but the Customer Record in ADP
Payments was not updated with the new bank information, so the payment you
processed was sent to the old bank and cannot be honored.
What to Do: Contact your customer to obtain new Routing Number and Bank Account Number
information, then enter a NEW transaction using the updated account numbers.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 568
R13 Invalid ACH Routing Number
R16 Account Frozen
R17 File Record Edit Criteria (Specify)
NACHA Definition: Entry contains a Receiving DFI Identification or OGO Identification that is not a valid
ACH routing number.
What it Means: The Routing Number entered for the transaction is invalid and does not belong to any
bank in the ACH Network.
What to Do: Your ADP Payments system is designed to validate routing numbers prior to
submitting transactions for processing‐‐so you should never see this reason code.
If you do see the code, double‐check that you entered the Routing Number correctly,
and contact your customer to confirm it if necessary. Then submit a NEW payment
using the correct routing number.
If you have confirmed that the routing number you entered is correct, contact ADP
Payments Customer Care so that we can investigate the problem.
NACHA Definition: Access to the account is restricted due to specific action taken by the RDFI or by legal
action.
What it Means: The payment cannot be honored because the account has been frozen and no
transactions can be processed against it.
What to Do: Contact your customer to obtain a different form of payment. You will not be able to
process transactions using this bank account until it is un‐frozen.
NACHA Definition: Some fields that are not edited by the ACH Operator are edited by the RDFI. If the
entry cannot be processed by the RDFI, the field(s) causing the processing error must
be identified in the addenda record information field of the return.
What it Means: Your customer’s bank had a technical problem with the ACH transaction record
submitted for this payment.
What to Do: Contact ADP Payments Customer Care so that we can investigate the problem.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 569
R18 Improper Effective Entry Date
R19 Amount Field Error  
R20 Non‐Transaction Account  
NACHA Definition: The effective entry date for a credit entry is more than two banking days after the
banking day of processing as established by the Originating ACH Operator...The
effective entry date for a debit entry is more than one banking day after the
processing date.
What it Means: The date entered in the ACH transaction record is invalid and the transaction cannot
be processed.
What to Do: The ADP Payments system is designed to submit scheduled transactions only on the
exact date they are scheduled to occur, so you should never see this return code.
If you do see this code, please contact ADP Payments Customer Care so that we can
investigate further.
NACHA Definition: Amount field is non‐numeric...Amount field is notzero in a prenotification, DNE, ENR,
Notification of Change, Refused Notification of Change, orzero dollar entry....Amount
field is zero in an entry other than a prenotification, DNE, ENR, Notification of
Change, Refused Notification of Change, Return, Dishonored Return, Contested
Dishonored Return, or zero dollar entry....Amount field is greater than $25,000 for
ARC, BOC, and POP entries.
What it Means: The payment was entered for an amount of $0, or a paper‐check conversion (ARC or
BOC) was entered for over $25,000.
What to Do: The ADP Payments system is designed to prevent zero dollar transactions and
transactions over $25,000, so you should never see this error.
If you do see this code for a transaction under $25,000, please contact ADP Payments
Customer Care so that we can investigate further.
NOTE: You should not be converting paper checks to ACH transactions in ADP
Payments. The system does not support the ACH Transaction types used with paper
checks. If you did process a paper check as an ACH Transaction, your customer can
claim that the payment was not authorized.
NACHA Definition: The ACH entry destined for a non‐transaction account, as defined in Regulation D,
would include either an account against which transactions are prohibited or limited
or a pass‐through where the entry is for a credit union or thrift organization and
Regulation E descriptive requirements cannot be met.
What it Means: The bank account you entered cannot be used for ACH Payments.
What to Do: Contact your customer to obtain authorization to charge a different bank account.
(Be certain that your customer confirmsthe account is enabled for ACH transactions.)
Or, ask for a different form of payment.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 570
R24 Duplicate Entry
R26 Mandatory Field Error
R28 Routing Number Check Digit Error
NACHA Definition: The RDFI has received what appears to be a duplicate entry; i.e., the trace number,
date, dollar amount and/or other data matches another transaction. This code should
be used with extreme care. The RDFI should be aware that if a file has been
duplicated, the Originator may have already generated a reversal transaction to
handle the situation.
What it Means: There was a technical error that caused your transaction to be transmitted twice, or
your customer’s bank thinks that such an error occurred.
What to Do: Contact ADP Payments Customer Care so we can investigate the problem.
NACHA Definition: Individual Name contains all spaces or all zeros (MTE, TEL, and WEB entries)....Check
Serial Number contains all spaces or all zeros (ARC, BOC, POP, RCK, or XCK entries)....
What it Means: For a TEL or WEB ACH Transaction, the name of the account holder was not provided.  
What to Do: The ADP Payments system is designed to prevent you from submitting transactions
with these fields missing. If you see this error, there was likely a technical problem.
Please contact Customer Care so that we can investigate further.
NACHA Definition: The Check Digit for a Routing Number is not valid.
What it Means: The bank routing number is invalid.
What to Do: The ADP Payments system is designed to prevent you from submitting transactions
with invalid routing numbers, but in rare cases you may see this error. Double check
the routing number entered, and if necessary confirm it with your customer. (You
may want to ask your customer to fax a copy of a voided check so that you can
double‐check the value yourself.)
If you’ve corrected a data entry error, you can enter the payment again as a NEW
transaction.
If you’ve confirmed the routing number was entered correctly on the original
transaction, please contact Customer Care so that we can investigate further.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 571
R29 Corporate Customer Advises Not Authorized  
R32 RDFI Non‐Settlement   
NACHA Definition: The RDFI has been notified by the Receiver (non‐consumer) that a specific transaction
has not been authorized by the Receiver.
What it Means: The company you attempted to debit has notified the bank that the transaction was
not authorized. Or, you attempted to debit a business bank account that is not
enabled for ACH transactions.
This is an “unauthorized” return code, and will result in your account being assessed
the ACH Chargeback Fee. See ACH Chargeback Return Codes for more information.
You cannot re‐submit this transaction. Any additional transactions you attempt to
process against this account will also be returned unless your business customer
specifically instructs his bank to enable the account for ACH transactions.
What to Do: Immediately suspend any recurring payment schedules entered for this bank
account. This will prevent additional transactions from being returned while you
address the issue with your customer.
Contact your customer and resolve any issues that caused them to claim the
transaction was unauthorized, then have your customer call the bank and remove the
block on transactions your company initiates. Or, if the problem is account
configuration, ask your customer to have the business bank account enabled for ACH
transactions. Then contact ADP Payments Customer Care and inform them that the
block has been lifted. You will be informed when it is permissible to re‐submit the
transaction.
Alternately, you can ask the customer for a different form of payment, or ask to debit
a different bank account.   Be certain to get proper authorization from your customer
to debit the new account. (See Authorizing Echeck (ACH) Transactions for more
information on how to do this.)
Unfortunately, there is no dispute resolution available to you within the ACH
Network. If your customer continues to claim the transaction was not authorized, but
you have proof that it was properly authorized, you will need to sue your customer in
Small Claims Court to collect.
NACHA Definition: The RDFI is not able to settle the entry
What it Means: Your customer’s bank rejected the transaction.
What to Do: Have your customer contact the bank to find out what caused the problem.
When the problem is remedied you can re‐submit the payment as a NEW ACH
transaction. You can also ask your customer for authorization to charge a different
bank account, or ask for an alternate form of payment.
Appendix B: ACH Return Codes : Directory of ACH Return Codes 572
R34 Limited Participation DFI    
R37 Source Document Presented for Payment     
NACHA Definition: The RDFI's participation has been limited by a federal or state supervisor
What it Means: Your customer’s bank is not able to process the ACH payment you initiated.
What to Do: Ask your customer for authorization to charge a different bank account, or ask for an
alternate form of payment.
NACHA Definition: The source document to which an ARC, BOC, or POP entry relates has been presented
for payment. The Receiver may request immediate credit from the RDFI for an ARC,
BOC, or POP entry for the reason described above. The request must be made in
writing within fifteen (15) days after the RDFI sends or makes available to the
Receiver information relating to that debit entry. The Receiver must also provide the
RDFI with a written statement that the source document was presented for payment.
An RDFI using this return reason code must transmit the return entry by its ACH
Operator's deposit deadline for the return entry to be made available to the ODFI no
later than the opening of business on the banking day following the sixtieth calendar
day following the Settlement Date of the ARC, BOC, or POP entry.
What it Means: A paper check was converted to an ACH transaction, and was also submitted in paper
form to the bank for standard processing‐‐ thus the same payment was processed
twice.
You will see this error if your customer notifies the bank that a check they wrote was
converted to ACH  in addition to being processed normally. Additionally, the bank can
identify the duplication and assign this code without notifying your customer first.
The bank will then “return” the ACH transaction and refund the customer's account,
or will simply not process the duplicate transaction.
What to Do: Check your records to determine if you accidentally entered an ACH transaction for a
paper check that you took the check to the bank. If you did, then this “return”
remedied the error, and you don’t need to take any further action.
If you’re sure you did not take the check to the bank (for example, you still have the
original in your files), contact your customer to resolve the mistake‐‐keeping in mind
that the bank may have issued the return without the customer’s knowledge.
NOTE: As of March 2010, this code will be counted as an unauthorized “chargeback.”
However, you should not be converting paper checks to ACH transactions in ADP
Payments. The system does not support the ACH Transaction types used with paper
checks. If you did process a paper check as an ACH Transaction, your customer can
claim that the payment was not authorized. Contact ADP Payments Customer Care
for assistance with this transaction.
Appendix C: Import Requirements 573
Appendix C: Import Requirements
ADP Payments enables you to import batches of Customers, Payments, Recurring Payment Schedules, and invoice
List Items. Detailed instructions on performing batch uploads can be found in Import Center in Chapter 8.
Import types have different field requirements. The import file itself must adhere to the following rules:
• Must be in .csv or pipe delimited text format.
NOTE: To convert an Excel file into .csv format, use the “save as” function and select “csv” as the file
type.
• For best results, all fields, even those containing numbers and dates should be formatted as “text.”
• Must not contain anything but text‐‐ (merge field code, SQL code, javascript, etc., even if in an
unmapped field, will cause the file to be rejected.)
• Must contain values for all required fields, based on import type.
The following sections provide specific requirements for each ADP Payments import‐type. The Guide to System
Fields provides acceptable values and formats for each field.
Currently ADP Paymentssupports only U.S. and Canadian addresses. You cannot import
customers with an address in any other country.
When entering credit card and bank account numbers it is critical that you format the
field as “text.” These numbers can easily become corrupted if not entered as a text
value.
To do this in Excel, enter a ‘ prior to the card value. For example, enter
‘5454545454545454’ when entering a MasterCard with a number of
5454545454545454.
Appendix C: Import Requirements : Customer Import Requirements 574
Customer Import Requirements
Customer imports are comprised of two sections‐‐ Information about the customer and the customer’s payment
accounts.   Name and billing address are required for all Customer Records.  All other fields are optional.
You can import one bank account and one credit card account for each Customer Record. These accounts will be
labeled as the “default” accounts for this customer. You can add additional accounts, and change the default
account, by editing each customer individually. (See Editing Customer Information in Chapter 6 for instructions.)
The following table outlines the required and optional fields for a Customer Record, as well as the bank account and
credit card fields that can be included as part of a customer import.  
*NOTE: If the Country field is unmapped or left blank, it will default to USA.
You can include a bank account, a credit card, or both in your Customer import.  
However, you may not enter partial information for a bank account or credit card.
For example, if the “credit card number” is included and mapped, but the other credit
card fields are not included, the row will be rejected.

Appendix E: Customer Portal 601
Appendix E: Customer Portal
ADP Payments provides a Customer Portal that your customers can use to manage invoices and payments to your
company. The Customer Portal is co‐branded for your company and includes your logo, colors and contact
information.
Your customers access your Customer Portal when they click the “Pay Invoice Now” button in any of your emailed
invoices. The first time they attempt to pay one of your invoices, they are asked to enroll for a Customer Portal
account. If they choose to do so, they can login each time they pay an invoice. (They also have the option of paying
invoices without enrolling in Customer Portal.)
This appendix provides detailed instructions on how to use all Customer Portal functions. The same information is
available to your customers from the “Help” link at the right of the Customer Portal top navigation bar.
The following sections first describe how to create and manage your ADP Payments Customer Records so that your
customers are provided access to your Customer Portal. Each Customer Portal function is described in detail.
ADP Payments does not provide technical support for your customers directly. It is a
good idea for you to familiarize yourself with the features and functions of Customer
Portal so you can assist your customers if they have questions.
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Feature and Function Overview 602
Feature and Function Overview
The following functions are available in Customer Portal:
• Your customers can manage their own account information (email address, password, bank accounts,
credit card accounts).
• Your customers can view and pay their invoices‐‐ both one‐time invoices and those generated by
recurring invoice schedules.
• Your customers can view a complete payment history, including invoice payments, one‐time payments,
and payments generated by recurring payment schedules.
• Your customers can print all invoices and save all invoices as .pdf files.
Your customers can also pay invoices without creating a Customer Portal account. Additionally, by using Web
Payment Pages, you can enable customers to make individual payments as well as enter bill payment and payment
plan schedules via payment forms accessible from your website. (See Web Payment Pages in Chapter 8.)
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Customer Access to Customer Portal 603
 Customer Access to Customer Portal
Any customer who chooses to enroll can gain access to your Customer Portal. Currently, there is no way to block
Customer Portal access.
Customers can access the enrollment screen by clicking the “not enrolled?” link on the screen they see after clicking
a “Pay Invoice” button in an invoice PDF or the “click here” link in an invoice email. (See Customer Enrollment in
Customer Portal.)
Customers can also enroll while making a payment on a web payment form. (See Enroll on a Web Payment Page for
details.)
Once enrolled you will see the User ID the customer selected when you view or edit the Customer Record.   
You will also be able to re‐set the customer’s password using the “reset customer’s password” link. Clicking this link
will send an email to your customer with a temporary password that can be used for a single login. After logging in
with the temporary password, your customer will be prompted to create a personal password. If customers get
locked out of an account due to excessive failed login attempts, they will need to contact you to reset the password.
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Linking to Customer Portal From Your Website 604
Linking to Customer Portal From Your Website
Customers are automatically provided the option to login to your Customer Portal when they click a “Pay Invoice
Now” button in any emailed invoice. When they login using this option, they are immediately shown the invoice that
they want to pay.
You can also create links on your website that enable your customers to access your Customer Portal at any time.
This allows them to view their account history and manage address and payment account information without
having to make a payment.
Use the following case‐sensitive URL format to link to Customer Portal:
https://payments.paysimple.com/Payments/Login/Buyer/AccountID
When you program your link, replace “accountID” with your ADP Payments Account ID. Your Account ID is located
on the your account tab in the Settings section.
In the above screen capture the Account ID is 1072, which makes the link to this company’s Customer Portal:
https://payments.paysimple.com/Payments/Login/Buyer/1072
When customers click this link, they will go directly to your Customer Portal login screen.

SAVED PAYMENT METHODS
One of the big advantages to using Customer Portal is that customers can securely store the bank accounts and
credit cards they will use to make payments so they don’t have to enter them each time they pay an invoice or place
an order.
The stored payment account information is encrypted using state‐of‐the‐art technology, and can only be decrypted
during the course of a transaction‐‐ which is why the full bank account or credit card number is never displayed on
payment forms or anywhere in the system.
If customers have done business with you prior to enrolling in Customer Portal, they may see bank accounts and/or
credit cards already stored in the system when they first access it, as shown below. First time customers will only see
fields for entering new accounts.
Managing Credit Card Accounts
The Credit card accounts section displays a table of cards stored in the customer’s account. The table includes the
truncated card number, the expiration date, the card type, and indicates which of the cards is the default credit card
account. Customers can store as many credit cards in the system as they like. Each time they make a payment, they
will be able to select the account to use.
1. To change the expiration date of the card:
  a. Click the “edit” link.
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Managing Account Information 613

section.
2. To delete a stored credit card, click the “delete” link and click “ok” in the pop‐up box to confirm the delete.
NOTE: Customers will only be able to delete a credit card if there are no unsettled transactions currently
attached to the card. When attempting to delete a credit card attached to a recurring payment schedule,
customers will be asked to choose a different saved card to use with the schedule. If no other credit cards
are saved, the customer will not be able to delete the credit card.
NOTE: If a customer deletes the default credit card the most recently added card will be set as the new
default. If there are no other credit cards, the next one added, by either you or your customer, will be set as
the default credit card.

Appendix E: Customer Portal : Invoice Emails 631
Invoice Emails
Your customer will receive an email notification for each invoice entered for them, whether one‐time or part of an
invoice schedule. Depending on how you configure your invoices and schedules, the invoice email will provide basic
details about the invoice (such as Invoice # and total due), will display a condensed version of the invoice below the
introductory text (including line items, taxes, discounts, payments made, and balance due), and will include a “pay
invoice now button” that will enable your customers to log‐into Customer Portal to view the invoice and make a
payment (or download a .pdf version of the invoice), or to view the invoice online and pay it as a guest (or download
the .pdf as a guest) if you have configured your system to accept guest payments. (See Invoice Settings in Chapter 8
for how to configure this setting.)
NOTE: The invoice email your customer receives will have a logo at the bottom that informs your customer that ADP
Payments is the secure invoicing provider.
You can also elect to attach the .pdf version of the invoice to the email itself. (See New Invoices and Invoice
Schedules in Chapter 5 for how to configure invoice email settings.)
NOTE: The .pdf version of the invoice also contains a “Pay Invoice Now” button that opens the log‐in page where
your customer can log‐in to make a payment, or pay as a guest (if you have that option enabled.)
The invoice email will look something like this:
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Invoice Emails 632
The PDF attached to the email, and the PDF version accessible online, will look something like this:
To pay the invoice, customers click the “PAY INVOICE NOW” button at the bottom‐right of the PDF, which will open
the log‐in screen. This is the same log‐in screen customers see when they click the “click here” link in the invoice
email.
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Invoice Emails 633
The Customer Portal log‐in screen is shown below:
Customers can decide whether to login to Customer Portal to make a payment, or pay the invoice without creating a
Customer Portal account.
NOTE: If you do not configure your ADP Payments account to enable invoice payment without logging in, then this
option will not be available, and the “view and pay invoice as guest” link will not appear.
After logging in (or clicking the pay as guest link), customers see the invoice in payment mode, as shown below. If
logged in, their billing information is pre‐filled in the billing area, if a guest all fields are blank as in this example.
When you resend invoice emails, or when customers re‐access an existing invoice
online, the invoice will reflect its the current status, as well as any payments made on
it. For example, in the screen capture below the invoice has a status of “Paid (partial)”
and the $45 payment as well as the $45 balance are displayed.

reports.
Any payment made while a customer is not logged in, even a payment of an invoice
created for them, will result in a new Customer Record being created. The payment will
be attached to the new Customer Record, not to the Customer Record associated with
the invoice.
For this reason, your own reporting will be easier to manage if you require (or
encourage it if you don’t want to require it) your customersto enroll in Customer Portal
and login each time they make a payment.
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Paying Invoices Without a Customer Portal Account 637
To pay the invoice:
1. Review the invoice details in the table, the taxes charged, and the Total due.
2. In the Payment type section, select either Credit Card or Echeck (ACH) as the invoice payment method.
NOTE: If your ADP Payments account is configured for only Credit Card or only Echeck (ACH) processing
then only one payment method will be available and no selection need be made. If both options are
available, Credit Card is selected by default.   
3. The Amount to pay section indicates the invoice balance, and provides the opportunity to pay the invoice
in full, or to make a partial payment.
NOTE: The partial payment option will only be available if your ADP Payments account is configured to
accept partial payments.
  a. By default the Full amount radio button will be selected, with the total amount of the invoice
indicated. To pay the invoice in full, leave this radio button selected.
  b. If partial payments are permitted the Partial amount radio button and box will also be visible. To enter
a partial payment, select its radio button and enter any amount less than the total due in the box.
  c. If a partial payment has already been made, then the Full amount radio button will indicate the invoice
balance (total due ‐ partial payments). The balance can be paid, or an additional partial payment made.
NOTE: Customers can make multiple payments on an invoice without logging in. Each time they access
the invoice, the Balance Remaining line on the invoice and the Full amount radio button will reflect
the balance due on the invoice. If they click the “PAY INVOICE NOW” button from the invoice email,
and the invoice has been paid in full, they will see $0 in the Full amount field, and there will be no
“pay” button on the page for submitting a payment. If a customer does not log in when making partial
payments, each partial payment will generate a new Customer Record, and the payments will not be
connected to a single customer. However, all the payments will be connected to the invoice.
4. Depending on the payment method selected in step 2 above, enter account information in the fields
provided.
  a. For Credit Card:
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Paying Invoices Without a Customer Portal Account 638
  i. Select the Card type from the drop‐down box.
  ii. Enter the Card number.
  iii. Enter the CVV2 Code. (This is the four digit number on the front of American Express cards, or the
three digit number on the back of Visa, MasterCard and Discover cards.)
  iv. Enter the card’s Expiration date using the first drop‐down box for the month and the second drop‐
down box for the year.
  v. Leave the Set as default account box unchecked.
NOTE: As a new Customer Record is created whenever an invoice is paid while a customer is not
logged in, the credit card will automatically be set as the default account, regardless of whether
the box is checked, since it will be the only one associated with the new Customer Record.
  b. For Bank Account:
  i. Enter the Bank name.
  ii. Enter the 9‐digit Bank routing number.
  iii. Enter the Bank account number.
  iv. Select “Checking” or “Savings” as the Account type.
  v. Leave the Set as default account box unchecked.
NOTE: As a new Customer Record is created whenever an invoice is paid while a customer is not
logged in, the bank account will automatically be set as the default account, regardless of whether
the box is checked, since it will be the only one associated with the new Customer Record.
5. Enter billing name, address, and contact information in the Customer Information section.
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Paying Invoices Without a Customer Portal Account 639
6. Review the Terms and Conditions of Sale. The merchant Terms & Conditions are displayed in the text area.
These are the Terms and Conditions of Sale you entered on the Settings‐‐> configuration‐‐> invoice
settingsscreen. (See To Enter Terms of Sale: in Chapter 8 for details.) Customers can click the “Print Terms &
Conditions” link to print a copy if they want one.
Customers must also agree to the ADP Payments Payor Terms and Conditions when making a payment.
These can be viewed and printed by clicking the “Payor Terms and Conditions” link.
7. Click the “pay” button to agree to the Terms and Conditions and submit the payment.
8. A pop‐up box will appear asking you to confirm the payment amount. Click “pay” to process the payment,
or click “cancel” to return to the invoice and enter a different amount.
9. Any errors will appear at the top of the screen. Make any required corrections and click the “pay” button
again to submit the payment. When the payment is successful, the payment confirmation screen will
appear as shown below. Customers will also receive an email receipt for the payment.
Appendix E: Customer Portal : Online Payment Forms 640
Online Payment Forms
In addition to paying invoices via Customer Portal, the ADP Payments system enables your customers to make
purchases without an invoice via an online payment form.
You can include payment links and/or payment buttons on your website or in emails that will enable customers to
make payments online. These online forms can also be used to enable customers to create their own recurring
payment schedules. (See Web Payment Pages in Chapter 8 for instructions on how to use and create Web Payment
Forms and Web Payment Buttons.)
When making online payments via payment forms, customers have the option to login to your system to retrieve
saved billing, shipping, and payment account information, or to make a one‐time payment without creating an
account in your system.
When customers opt not to login, or if they haven’t enrolled in Customer Portal, they will have the option to create
a user account in your system as part of the payment form. If they leave this section blank, no account will be
created. If they create an account, they will be able to login on payment forms, and they will be able to login to
Customer Portal to manage their account, and review their invoice and payments history.

Appendix F: Funding Times 652
Appendix F: Funding Times
The most common question merchants ask about payment processing in ADP Payments is: When will I get my
money?
The answer to that question depends on the type of transaction processed and the funding time associated with the
ACH or Credit Card merchant processing account.
The following sections provide detailed information about ACH (E‐check) and credit card funding times. Use these
sections to fully understand the many details that can affect when you receive funds for transactions processed in
ADP Payments. For a high‐level look at what you can typically expect for each transaction type, refer to the “At a
Glance” summaries.
Appendix F: Funding Times : Funding Times for ACH (E‐check) Transactions 653
Funding Times for ACH (E-check) Transactions
The ACH transaction funding cycle is comprised of 5 steps:
1. Initiation Day‐‐ The day the transaction is entered into an ACH batch by the processor.
2. Effective Date‐‐ The date the transaction enters the ACH Network.
3. Funding Time‐‐ The time it takes the transaction to work its way through the ACH network and for the ACH
processor to confirm that the transaction is valid.
4. Settlement Date‐‐ The day the settlement deposit is made by your ACH Processor to your bank account.
This is also the date ADP Payments records as the transaction “Settlement Date.”
5. Posting Day‐‐ The day your bank posts the ACH provider's deposit to your account; and the day ADP
Payments changes the status of the transaction to “Settled.”
Each of your ACH (E‐check) transactions will progress through these steps based on the funding time assigned to
your ACH processing account. The ACH Transaction Settling at a Glance section below provides typical cycles for ACH
transaction funding based on the day a payment is processed and your funding time.
Many factors such as the time you enter a transaction, bank holidays, and your own bank’s policy for posting
deposits will affect how quickly your ACH transactions settle. The The ACH Funding Cycle section provides detailed
explanations of them all. To see how these factors can affect individual funding times, review the ACH Funding
Examples.
You will not see an individual deposit in your bank account for each ACH (E‐check)
transaction you process in ADP Payments. Your ACH provider will make a single deposit
to your account for all settled transactions on a single date.
For Example: If you process 4 transactions that have the same settlement date: A
$25.00 payment, a $10.00 payment, a $30.00 payment, and a $20.00 refund; you will
see a single deposit from your ACH Processor for $45.00. (25 + 10 + 30 ‐ 20 = 45)
Reconciliation Reporting
To run a report in ADP Payments for reconciliation to determine the transactions
included in a specific deposit, open the “Settled Transactions” standard report, and
apply the following filters:
• In the Date Range filter set a Custom Date Range. Enter the Settlement Date in
the From and To fields. This filter controls the records returned based on the
Actual Settle Date field
NOTE: This filter settings is based on standard bank posting practices. If your
bank posts on a different schedule, adjust the date filter accordingly.
• In the Payment Methods filter, select only “ACH.”
Appendix F: Funding Times : Funding Times for ACH (E‐check) Transactions 654
ACH TRANSACTION SETTLING AT A GLANCE
Use the following charts to determine when you will typically see a deposit in your bank account for ACH(E‐check)
transactions processed using ADP Payments. Note that the deposit itself will typically be made in the late afternoon
on the Settlement Date, which is the business day BEFORE the Posting Day; it simply will not appear on statements
until the Posting Day.
These charts assume that you have entered the transaction prior to the day's batch cut‐off time of 5:00 PM Eastern
Time, and that no bank holidays fall within the funding time.
NOTE: The charts are only guides, as many factors can affect when a transaction settles, and when you see the
deposit for that transaction. See The ACH Funding Cycle section for detailed information.

Appendix F: Funding Times : Funding Times for ACH (E‐check) Transactions 655
THE ACH FUNDING CYCLE
As noted at the beginning of this section, each ACH (E‐check) transaction moves through a 5 stage funding cycle:
Initiation Day, Effective Date, Funding Time, Settlement Date and Posting Day. (See above for definitions.)
Determining the exact funding date for individual ACH transactions depends on the following key components which
affect when the transaction reaches each stage:
• Your ACH funding time
• Your ACH Batch cut‐off time
• Non‐banking days
• The Time and Date a transaction was entered in ADP Payments
• Your bank's policy for posting funds to your account
Each of these components is described in detail below. Specific funding examples are provided in the next section.
Paper Checks or ACH Processing: Which is the Fastest Way to Get Your Money?
When you deposit a paper check at your bank, you often see the deposit posted on the
same day or on the next day.  So, you may wonder why ACH transactions processed
electronically seem to take quite a bit longer.
The answer lies in the difference between “Posting” date and “Settlement” date.
The “Posting” date is simply the day the bank's computer system reports on a
transaction in your account. It is not related to the day the bank actually makes funds
available to you.
The “Settlement” date is the day the bank releases funds for your use.
With a paper check deposited at your bank, the “Posting” date is often many days
(sometimes up to 30!) prior to the “Settlement” date.
With ACH transactions processed via ADP Payments, the “Posting” date actually occurs
after the “Settlement” date. Thus as soon as you see a deposit from your ACH
processor, you know that the funds are available to you immediately.
So, when you factor in the time it takes for a paper check your customer mails to reach
you, the time it takes for you to actually get to the bank to deposit it, and the time the
bank holds your money‐‐‐ you'll see that processing ACH Transactions electronically can
be significantly faster!
Appendix F: Funding Times : Funding Times for ACH (E‐check) Transactions 656
Your ACH Funding Time
When your ACH merchant account is approved you will be provided with your funding time. Most ADP Payments
customers use 3‐day funding. Other funding times are 5‐day, 10‐day, and 30‐day. Typically, higher‐risk businesses
will have longer funding times.
Your ACH Batch Cut-off Time
The batch cut‐off time is when an ACH transaction file is closed and submitted into the ACH Network for processing.
Batches can be closed once per day, or multiple times per day. Transactions are placed in the batch open at the time
they are entered. The ADP Payments ACH batch close time is 5:00 PM Eastern Time.
Non-Banking Days
No transaction processing takes place on these days. They should be skipped in all bank‐related funding time
calculations. ADP Payments updates transaction statuses on these days.

• Sunday
• Bank Holidays
• New Years Day  (January)
• Martin Luther King Day  (January)

The Time and Date a Transaction was Entered
The time and date a transaction was entered into ADP Payments is used to determine the batch in which it is
included. The batch date is the Initiation Day for the transaction.
A transaction's Effective Date is the first bank business day after the Initiation Day. This is typically the day after the
Initiation Day. However, weekends and bank holidays can delay the Effective Date.
The ADP Payments application will provide the transaction date and time on the Transaction Details screen.
NOTE: If the Void function is available, the transaction is in an open batch.
Your Bank's Policy for Posting Funds to Your Account
Each bank has a different policy for when it makes funds available to its customers. ACH Processors typically send
deposits to your bank in the afternoon, and your bank posts them to your account on the next business day. Some
banks will post the deposit immediately upon receipt; and others may wait several days before posting it.
ADP Payments will display a status of “Settled” for a transaction the day after the deposit is made to your bank
account, but it will use the deposit date as the Settlement Date recorded in the system. In most cases you will see
the status update to “Settled” in ADP Payments on the same day you see the deposit posted to your bank account. If
you are concerned that your bank account is not accurately reflecting ADP Payments reporting, contact your bank
and ask about its funds posting policy.
Detailed examples follow in the next section.

ACH FUNDING EXAMPLES
The following sections provide examples for 3‐day funding and 5‐day funding of ACH Transactions.
3-Day ACH Funding Examples
Typical 3‐day funding works as follows:
1. Initiation Day: The date of the ACH batch that contains the transaction. This is the same date the
transaction is entered, if processed prior to the batch close time. If processed after the batch close time,
this is the next day.
2. Funding Day 1 (Effective Date): The first day of transaction processing. This is the first business day after
the Initiation Day.
NOTE: Your customer will see funds debited from their bank account on this day.
3. Funding Day 2: The second day of transaction processing.
4. Funding Day 3 (Settlement Date): The third and final day of processing. The processor will release the
funds to your account this afternoon.
5. ADP Payments will record this date as the “Settlement Date” for the transaction.
NOTE: On this date it is common to see the “Settlement Date” in ADP Payments display the current date,
while the transaction “Status” still displays “Posted.”
6. Posting Day: The date money appears in your bank account and the date ADP Payments updates the status
of the transaction to “Settled.”
NOTE: Remember that your bank posts transactions on its own schedule, which may not align with these
examples.
ADP Payments transaction status updates are performed at 6:30 AM Eastern Time. Your transactions are updated to
“Settled” on the Posting Day at approximately that time.
The following examples detail several 3‐day ACH funding scenarios.

Appendix F: Funding Times : Funding Times for ACH (E‐check) Transactions 666
Funding Time for ACH Refunds
Most ACH Refunds use 5‐day funding, regardless of your individual ACH funding time.(See above for how 5‐day
funding works.) Thus, money will typically be debited from your account on the Effective Date (the business day
after the transaction is processed). It will typically reach your customer 6 business days after the transaction is
processed.
Funding Times for Recurring ACH Transactions
Recurring ACH transactions are processed at 3:30AM (Eastern Time) each day. The following table defines the Batch
Day, Initiation Day, and Effective Day for recurring transactions based on the day they are generated by ADP
Payments.
With 3‐day funding, the funding cycle completes 3 banking days after the Effective Day. With 5‐day funding, the
cycle completes 5 banking days after the Effective Day.

Appendix F: Funding Times : Funding Times for Credit Card Transactions 667
Funding Times for Credit Card Transactions
The Credit Card transaction funding cycle is comprised of 3 steps:
1. Initiation Day: The day the transaction is entered and authorized.
2. Processing Time: The time it takes the transaction to be included in a settlement batch and work its way
through the credit card processing network.
3. Posting Day: The day your bank posts the credit card processors deposit to your account and ADP Payments
changes the status of the transaction to “Settled.”
Each of your credit card transactions will progress through these steps based on the funding time assigned to your
processing account. The Credit Card Transaction Settling at a Glance section below provides typical cycles for credit
card transaction funding based on the day a payment is processed.
Many factors such as the time you enter a transaction, bank holidays, and your own bank’s policy for posting
deposits will affect how quickly your credit card transactions settle. The Credit Card Funding Cycle section provides
detailed explanations of them all. To see how these factors can affect individual funding times, review the Credit
Card Funding Examples.
You will not see an individual deposit in your bank account for each Credit Card
transaction you process in ADP Payments. Your credit card processor will make a single
deposit to your account for all settled transactions on a single date.
For Example: If you process 4 transactions on the same Initiation Day: A $25.00
payment, a $10.00 payment, a $30.00 payment, and a $20.00 refund; you will see a
single deposit from your processor for $45.00. (25 + 10 + 30 ‐ 20 = 45)
Reconciliation Reporting
To run a report in ADP Payments for reconciliation to determine the transactions
included in a specific deposit, open the “Settled Transactions” standard report, and
then apply the following filters:
• In the Payment Methods filter, select all credit card types, or any combination
of “Visa,” “MasterCard,” “American Express,” and “Discover.”
NOTE: Typically Visa, MasterCard and Discover transactions processed on the
same day will settle on the same day, and American Express transactions made
on that day will settle a day later.
• In the Date Range filter set a Custom Date Range. Enter the Posting Date in the
From and To fields.
NOTE: This filter setting is based on standard bank posting practices. If your
bank posts on a different schedule, adjust the date filter accordingly.
Appendix F: Funding Times : Funding Times for Credit Card Transactions 668
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION SETTLING AT A GLANCE
Use the following charts to determine when you will typically see a deposit in your bank account for credit card
transactions processed using ADP Payments.
These charts assume that you have entered the transaction prior to the day's batch cut‐off time, and that no bank
holidays fall within the funding time.
NOTE: The charts are only guides, as many factors can affect when a transaction settles, and when you see the
deposit for that transaction. In some cases you may see a deposit prior to a transaction being shown as “settled” in
ADP Payments. See The Credit Card Funding Cycle section for detailed information.

THE CREDIT CARD FUNDING CYCLE
As noted at the beginning of this section, each credit card transaction moves through a 3‐step funding cycle:
Initiation Day, Processing Time and Posting Day. (See above for definitions.) Determining the exact funding date for
individual credit card transactions depends on the following key components which affect when the transaction
reaches each stage:
• Credit Card Batch Closing time.
• The type of credit card used.
• Non‐banking days
• The Time and Date a transaction was entered in ADP Payments
• Your bank's policy for posting funds to your account
Each of these components is described in detail below.  Specific funding examples are provided in the next section.
Credit Card Batch Closing Time.
All ADP Payments Credit Card batches close at 11 PM Eastern Time.
The Type of Credit Card Used
Visa, MasterCard and Discover transactions require 1 processing day. American Express transactions require 2
processing days.
Non-Banking Days
No transaction processing takes place on these days.  They should be skipped in all funding time calculations.
• Saturday
• Sunday
• Bank Holidays
• New Years Day  (January)
• Martin Luther King Day  (January)
• Presidents Day  (February)
• Memorial Day  (May)
• Independence Day  (July)
• Labor Day  (September)
• Columbus Day  (October)
• Veterans Day  (November)
• Thanksgiving Day  (November)
• Christmas Day  (December)
NOTE:  The exact date of bank holidays change each year.  For a list through 2014, see the table from the Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta (http://www.frbatlanta.org/about/holidays/)
The Time and Date a Transaction was Processed
The time and date a transaction was processed is used to determine the batch in which it is included.   ADP
Payments will provide the transaction date. It is up to you to keep track of the time a transaction was entered.
NOTE: If the transaction status is "Authorized" it is in an open batch.
Your Bank's Policy for Posting Funds to Your Account
Each bank has a different policy for when it makes funds available to its customers. Often, a deposit from your credit
card processor is not posted to your account until the business day after it is received.   Some banks post Friday
afternoon transactions on Saturday; others wait until Monday or Tuesday to post them.
ADP Payments will display a status of “Settled” for a transaction once the deposit has been initiated by your credit
card processor. If you are concerned that your bank account is not accurately reflecting ADP Payments reporting,
contact your bank and ask about its funds posting policy.
Appendix F: Funding Times : Funding Times for Credit Card Transactions 670
CREDIT CARD FUNDING EXAMPLES
The funding cycle is the same for Visa, MasterCard and Discover transactions, which all require only a single funding
day. American Express transactions require two funding days. The following sections provide detailed examples for
all card types.
Visa / MasterCard/ Discover Funding Examples
Typical Visa/MasterCard/Discover funding works as follows:
1. Initiation Day: The date the transaction is entered and authorized and the settlement batch is submitted.
Status in ADP Payments is “Authorized.”
2. Processing Day: The date of transaction processing. Status in ADP Payments is “Posted.”
NOTE: Your customer will see the charge reflected on their credit card statement on this day.
3. Posting Day: The date money appears in your bank account. The transaction will show as “Settled” in the
ADP Payments solution.

Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes 677
Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes
Credit card transactions will either be immediately successful (status of “Authorized”) or they will immediately fail
(status of “Failed”). The Reason Description: transmitted with the response indicates the type of failure (e.g.
decline) and the Authorization Code transmitted provides the specific reason for the failure.
Failed credit card transactions will display an on‐screen message that contains the type of failure (Reason
Description:). However, you will need to look at the Transaction Details screen in order to see the Authorization
Code that explains the failure.
The following sections provide detailed instructions for locating transaction failure codes, creating custom reports
that include those codes, and definitions for the Authorization Failure Codes that may be used to reject
transactions.
Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes : How to Read Credit Card Failure Codes 678
How to Read Credit Card Failure Codes
A credit card failure notice is comprised of two parts, the failure description and a number code that corresponds to
the specific reason for the failure.
When processing a payment manually via ADP Payments you will see a pop‐up message that contains the failure
reason, should a credit card transaction not be authorized. The pop‐up will appear over the greyed‐out Collect
Payment screen, and will look something like the following:
Click the “OK” button to clear the message and attempt the transaction again after making corrections, or by using a
different payment method.
NOTE: When customers make credit card payments via Customer Portal they will see this same error message if a
payment fails. After seeing this message, they will be able to make corrections or enter different payment
information and attempt the payment again. If this occurs, you will see both transactions documented in ADP
Payments Transaction History and Reports.
When viewing a failed credit card payment’s Transaction Details screen, you will be able to see both the failure
description and the numeric failure code, as shown below:
The following fields contain failure related information:
• Status: Indicates a credit card payment that was not authorized with a status of “Failed.” This status
will be the same for every failed credit card transaction, regardless of the failure reason.
• Reason Description: Contains the failure description. This is the same message you see in the pop‐up
failure notice. (See Directory of Credit Card Failure Codes below for a full list of all possible failure
description notices.)
• Authorization Code: Contains the two digit numeric failure code that indicates exactly why the
transaction failed. (See Most Common Credit Card Failure Codes for detailed descriptions of the failure
codes you are most likely to encounter, and Directory of Credit Card Failure Codes for detailed
descriptions of all failure codes.)
NOTE: For successful (authorized) credit card payments, the authorization code for the payment will be
displayed in this field.)
Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes : How to Read Credit Card Failure Codes 679
When credit card transaction generated by recurring payment schedules fail customers
will receive an email notification. (You can CC your company on these notices by editing
the “Failure Notice‐‐Recurring Payment Primary” email template. See Viewing and
Editing Email Templates in Chapter 8 for instructions.)
View the Transaction Detailsscreen for each failed recurring payment to determine the
failure Reason Description: and the failure code (or create a custom report that displays
this information.)

You can program a custom report to display both the Reason Description: field, which displays the failure
description, and the Authorization Code, which displays the failure code.
NOTE: None of the standard reports contain both these fields, but you can clone any standard report and then edit it
to add one or both failure fields.
To do this, clone a standard report and/or create a new custom report. (See Custom Reports in Chapter 7 for detailed
instructions.) Include the following:
• Select at least Transactions in the Include in Report section (you can include Customers as well if you
like.)
• Select any Date Range.
• Select Credit Card as the Payment Options Type
• Select Failed as the Payment Options Status.
• Select at least the following Transaction fields.
NOTE: You can select as many other fields as you like, but you need to include at least the ones below.
• Transaction.Status (This displays the Status of the transaction.)
• Transaction.Reason Description (This displays the failure description.)
NOTE: When viewing the custom report this field will have a column header of “Auth Code” even
though it is displaying data from the Reason Description: Field.
• Transaction.Trace Number (This displays the failure code.)
NOTE: This field is called “Trace Number” in custom reporting, even though it is displayed in the
Authorization Code field on the Transaction Details screen. Don’t confuse it with the Reason
Description: field above.

When you’re finished, the report configuration screen should look something like this:
When you view the report, it should look something like this:

Most Common Credit Card Failure Codes
The following failure messages and codes are the ones you are most likely to encounter when processing credit card
payments via you ADP Payments MOTO account. See Directory of Credit Card Failure Codes below, for a complete list
of failure codes applicable to your credit card processing account.
Description:Decline
Failure Code:05
Description:Decline
Failure Code:51
Description:Card No. Error
Failure Code:14
Failure Code Definition: Do not honor.
What it Means: The customer’sissuing bank is preventing the transaction from being authorized, and
instructing you not to honor the card.
What to Do: Have your customer call their issuing bank (the number is typically printed on the
back of the credit card) and ask why the transaction was declined and clear up any
problems that are causing the card to be declined. Once the issuing bank confirms
that they will approve future attempts, try the transaction again.
You can also ask your customer for a different credit card account or an ACH account,
and attempt the transaction again.
Failure Code Definition: Insufficient Funds
What it Means: The customer’s issuing bank is preventing the transaction from being authorized
because your customer is over his/her credit limit for the card (or processing the
attempted transaction would cause the customer to go over the limit).
What to Do: Have your customer call their issuing bank (the number is typically printed on the
back of the credit card) and ask for a credit limit increase that will permit the transac‐
tion to be processed. When the new limit is confirmed, attempt the transaction
again.
You can also ask your customer for a different credit card account or an ACH account,
and attempt the transaction again.
Failure Code Definition: Invalid Card Number.
What it Means: The card number entered is invalid.
What to Do: Double check the number and try the transaction again with a corrected number.
NOTE: If this error occurs for a payment generated by a recurring payment schedule,
you may want to suspend the schedule until you get a corrected card number from
your customer. You will be charged the authorization fee for each transaction
attempted with this invalid number.
Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes : Most Common Credit Card Failure Codes 683
Description:Expired Card
Failure Code:54
Description:Hold‐Call
Failure Code:41
Failure Code Definition: Expired Card
What it Means: The expiration date entered for the credit card is in the past.
NOTE: This error is most common for recurring payment transactions for which the
credit card attached to the schedule has not been updated with a new expiration
date.
What to Do: Contact your customer for the current expiration date for the credit card. Edit the
credit card account to reflect the new expiration date. (See Managing Customer Pay‐
ment Accounts in Chapter 6 for instructions.) This will update the expiration date for
all future one‐time transactions, and for all future payments generated by new or
existing recurring payment schedules using this credit card account.
Once the expiration date has been updated, you can process the transaction again.
NOTE: If a recurring payment fails due to an expiration date error, you can re‐process
the failed payment as a one‐time payment, and the schedule will pick‐up on the Next
Payment Date using the updated expiration date.
Failure Code Definition: Lost card, Pick up (fraud account).
What it Means: The customer’s issuing bank has prevented the transaction from being authorized
because the card’s rightful owner has reported it as lost.
NOTE: As you are not processing this transaction in person, you won’t be able to take
possession of the card.
What to Do: For a one time transaction, do not attempt the transaction again, and if possible do
not provide goods or services to the person attempting the transaction.
For a recurring or scheduled transaction, it is possible that the card was lost after the
last successfully processed payment (or after the authorization for the scheduled
payment). In that case, contact your customer for a new credit card number, or ask
for a different form of payment. Replace the lost account number on the schedule
with the new account number. (See Editing Recurring Payment Schedules in Chapter
4 for instructions.)
Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes : Most Common Credit Card Failure Codes 684
Description:Hold‐Call
Failure Code:43
Failure Code Definition: Stolen card, Pick up (fraud account).
What it Means: The customer’s issuing bank has prevented the transaction from being authorized
because the card’s rightful owner has reported it as stolen.
NOTE: As you are not processing this transaction in person, you won’t be able to take
possession of the card.
What to Do: For a one time transaction, do not attempt the transaction again, and if possible do
not provide goods or services to the person attempting the transaction.
For a recurring or scheduled transaction, it is possible that the card was stolen after
the last successfully processed payment (or after the authorization for the scheduled
payment). In that case, contact your customer for a new credit card number, or ask
for a different form of payment. Replace the stolen account number on the schedule
with the new account number. (See Editing Recurring Payment Schedules in Chapter
4 for instructions.)
If a Transaction is flagged as fraudulent, Failure Code 07, 41, or 43, be very careful
about doing business with the customer attempting the transaction.
If you do contact the customer to obtain a different payment account or method, be
certain that you take measures to verify identity and make certain that the person is
both authorized to use the card/account and who they say they are.
Do not ship goods or provide services until you see a successfully settled transaction in
ADP Payments.

Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes : Credit Card Decline Codes 685
Credit Card Decline Codes
The failure codes defined below are used when your customer’s bank declines an attempted transaction. If this
occurs, your two main remedies are to:
1. Contact your customer and ask for a different form of payment‐‐ either a different credit card or bank
account information to use for an ACH transaction.
2. Have your customer call their issuing bank (the number is typically printed on the back of the credit card)
and resolve any issues that are preventing the transaction from being approved. Once your customer
confirms that the bank will honor the card, you can attempt the transaction again.
When viewing a failed credit card payment’s Transaction Details screen, the transaction Status will be “Failed,” the
Reason Description will be “DECLINE” and the Authorization Code will be one of the following failure codes, as
shown below:
Description:Decline
Failure Code:05
Failure Code Definition: Do not honor.
What it Means: The customer’sissuing bank is preventing the transaction from being authorized, and
instructing you not to honor the card.
What to Do: Have your customer call their issuing bank (the number is typically printed on the
back of the credit card) and ask why the transaction was declined and clear up any
problems that are causing the card to be declined. Once the issuing bank confirms
that they will approve future attempts, try the transaction again.
You can also ask your customer for a different credit card account or an ACH account,
and attempt the transaction again.

because your customer is over his/her credit limit for the card (or processing the
attempted transaction would cause the customer to go over the limit).
What to Do: Have your customer call their issuing bank (the number is typically printed on the
back of the credit card) and ask for a credit limit increase that will permit the transac‐
tion to be processed. When the new limit is confirmed, attempt the transaction
again.
You can also ask your customer for a different credit card account or an ACH account,
and attempt the transaction again.
Failure Code Definition: Invalid service code, restricted
What it Means: This code will appear for one of two reasons:
1. You are attempting an American Express or Discover transaction and your mer‐
chant processing account is not configured properly to accept it.
2. An online payment was attempted by your customer using a credit card that does
not allow online payments.
What to Do: For Reason 1: Contact ADP Payments customer care at ADPPaymentsSupport@pay‐
simple.com or 800‐297‐5341 and request that your merchant account be configured
to accept Discover and American Express payments.
For Reason 2: Process the transaction again from the Collect Payment screen. You
should not see the error using this method. If it persists, contact your customer for a
different payment account (credit card or bank account) and attempt the payment
again using that payment information.
NOTE: You will not be able to see the full credit card number for the failed transac‐
tion, but if you select it on the Collect Payment screen you will be able to reattempt
the transaction.
Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes : Credit Card Decline Codes 687

back of the credit card) and ask them why the transaction is being declined. When
the your customer confirms that they have resolved any issues with their bank, and
that the card will be honored, attempt the transaction again.
You can also ask your customer for a different credit card account or an ACH account,
and attempt the transaction again.
Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes : Credit Card Hold‐Call Codes 688
Credit Card Hold-Call Codes
Hold‐Call failure codes typically involve some type of fraudulent activity associated with a credit card account. When
issued for a card‐present transaction, the cashier is supposed to take the card from the customer, call a special
number to report that the code was received, and retain the card.
NOTE: For failures with a “Call” code, as opposed to a “Hold‐Call” code, there is typically no fraud involved; there is
simply an issue with the account that your customer needs to resolve.
However, since you are processing MOTO (card not present) transactions with ADP Payments, you will not be able to
retrieve a credit card from a customer. When you see a Hold‐Call failure code, the best thing to do is stop and
investigate before providing any goods and services. If you see this code for a MOTO transaction, you are not
required to report it to your merchant processor.
When viewing a failed credit card payment’s Transaction Details screen, the transaction Status will be “Failed,” the
Reason Description will be “HOLD‐CALL” and the Authorization Code will be one of the following failure codes, as
shown below:
If a Transaction is flagged as fraudulent, Failure Code 07, 41, or 43, be very careful
about doing business with the customer attempting the transaction.
If you do contact the customer to obtain a different payment account or method, be
certain that you take measures to verify identity and make certain that the person is
both authorized to use the card/account and who they say they are.
Do not ship goods or provide services until you see a successfully settled transaction in
ADP Payments.

What to Do: Attempt the transaction again without entering a CVV2/CID number. It should pro‐
cess normally. If it does not, contact ADP Payments customer care at ADPPay‐
mentsSupport@paysimple.com or 800‐297‐5341 so that we can fix any configuration
error.
NOTE: If it does go though without the CVV2/CID code, for added security, you may
want to double check with your customer and get a corrected CVV2/CID code and try
it again. using the code (you can always void the second transaction.) An invalid code
can be a red flag for a fraudulent transaction.
Appendix G: Credit Card Failure Codes : Directory of Credit Card Failure Codes 700
Description:Stop Recurring
Failure Code:R0 or R1
Failure Code Definition: Customer requested stop of specific recurring payment
What it Means: Your customer instructed their card issuer not to accept recurring payments from
your company.
What to Do: Suspend the recurring schedule attached to this credit card immediately. Any addi‐
tional attempts to charge the card will likely result in a Chargeback.
Contact your customer and confirm that s/he wants to continue to do business with
you, and wants to resume the recurring billing schedule. You will need to obtain new
authorization in order to resume the schedule.
If the customer wants to resume the schedule using a different payment card or pay‐
ment method, you can do so once you have the new authorization. If the customer
wants to resume billing on the original account, s/he must contact the card issuer
and remove the stop placed against charges initiated by your company. Once you
confirm with the customer that the stop has been removed, you can resume the
recurring billing schedule.
