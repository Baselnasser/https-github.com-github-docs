name: Check unallowed file changes

# **What it does**: If someone changes some files in the open repo, we prevent the pull request from merging.
# **Why we have it**: Some files can only be changed in the internal repository for security and workflow reasons.
# **Who does it impact**: Open source contributors.

Hi# Tests

It's not strictly necessary to run tests locally while developing: You can
always open a pull request and rely on the CI service to run tests for you,
but sometimes it's helpful to run tests locally before pushing your changes to
GitHub.

Test are written using [jest](https://ghub.io/jest), a framework maintained
by Facebook and used by many teams at GitHub. Jest is convenient in that it
provides everything: a test runner, an assertion library, code coverage analysis,
custom reporters for different types of test output, etc.

### Install optional dependencies

We typically rely on CI to run our tests, so we consider some large test-only
dependencies **optional** (for example, puppeteer). In order to run the tests locally you'll
need to make sure optional dependencies are installed by running:

```sh
npm ci --include=optional
```

If you run into the error "Could not find expected browser (chrome) locally" you may need to manually install the expected chromium version with:
```
node node_modules/puppeteer/install.js
```

### Running all the tests

Once you've followed the development instructions above, you can run the entire
test suite locally:

```sh
script/test # or `npm test`
```

### Watching all the tests

You can also run a script that will continually watch for changes and
re-run the tests any time a change is made. This command will notify you
when tests change to and from a passing or failing state, and will also print
out a test coverage report, so you can see what files are in need of tests.

```sh
npm run test-watch
```

### Running individual tests

You can run specific tests in one of these two ways:

```sh
# The TEST_NAME can be a filename, partial filename, or path to a file or directory
npm test -- <TEST_NAME>

NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npx jest tests/unit
```

### Failed Local Tests

If the tests fail locally with an error like this:

`Could not find a production build in the '/Users/username/repos/docs-internal/.next' directory.`

You may need to run this before every test run:

```sh
npx next build
```

### Linting

To validate all your JavaScript code (and auto-format some easily reparable mistakes),
run the linter:

```sh
npm run lint
```
