DESCRIPTION:Laying the Foundation for Google Workspace for Education Securi
 ty Best Practices\n\n\nLetâ€™s get back to basics. Security in Google star
 ts with some foundational settings in the Admin Console to best control wh
 at type of Apps will have access to your domain\, how users login and more
  User and Device settings. Building off a solid security foundation helps 
 mitigate many potentially harmful situations and empowers Workspace for Ed
 ucation Admins to dive deeper with Security Tools such as the paid Workspa
 ce for Education editions. Participants will investigate their own domain 
 to see if their security foundation is solid or shaky. You will leave with
  security best practices and how to implement them in your own domain.\n\n

 e session will start with an introduction to the basics of the Investigati
