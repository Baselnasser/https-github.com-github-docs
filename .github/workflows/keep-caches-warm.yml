name: Keep caches warm

# **What it does**: Makes sure the caching of ./node_modules and ./.next
#                   is kept warm for making pull requests more rapid.
# **Why we have it**: A PR workflow that depends on caching can't reuse a
#                     cached artifact acorss PRs unless it also runs on `main`.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs engineering, open-source engineering contributors.
