name: Move and unlabel ready to merge PRs

# **What it does**: When a PR in the open source repo is labeled "ready to merge," the "waiting for review" label is removed and the PR is moved to the "Triage" column.
# **Why we have it**: To help with managing our project boards.
# **Who does it impact**: Open source contributors, open-source maintainers.
