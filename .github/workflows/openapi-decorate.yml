name: Sync OpenAPI schema

# **What it does**: Once a day, this workflow syncs the dereferenced files from github/rest-api-description and creates a pull request if there are updates to any of the static files we generate from the OpenAPI.
# **Why we have it**: So we can consume OpenAPI changes.
# **Who does it impact**: Anyone making OpenAPI changes in `github/github`, and wanting to get them published on the docs site.
