      # The "Purge Fastly" action takes about 6 minutes to purge all
      # languages. First does the language agnostic URLs, then English,
      # then all the other languages.
      # So it takes about ~30 seconds until it has sent the purge for
      # all English docs.

            ðŸš€ **This pull request has gone into production!**

            The SHA of https://docs.github.com/_build matches the merge commit in this PR.

            If you don't see updates when expected, try adding a random query string to the URL like `?bla=1234` and see if that helps.
            If that shows the expected content, it would indicate that the CDN is "overly caching" the page still. It will eventually update, but it can take a while.
