### What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?

<!-- Give as much detail as you can to help us understand the change you want to see. Why should the docs be changed? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? --> I actually am updating an original commitment began and never completed from a template that was forked from an original respiratory. Completing the package registration for bigcook12345.eth and postman.io Intergrating process. So that way I am able to update my resources committed in the github.io network to be fully integrated with both sites to run as uniform as possible. In the beginning, the ability to be able to complete "Full Registration, with Properly Committing Work Load". Was surely a complete misunderstanding on my end. After further review, completing the proper protocol as originally requested and stated, was not and is not completed until this instance. Being able to adjust as well as do justice to previous work? I by all means, am hoping that "Meeting the Originator's" standard's for completion of commitment is fully complete? The purpose of this commitment completion is more for updates, in the Bigcook12345.eth work load and package set up completion.
