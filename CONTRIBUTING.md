Introduction You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML name: GitHub Actions Demo on: [push] jobs: Explore-GitHub-Actions: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps:

run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event." run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!" run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}." name: Check out repository code uses: actions/checkout@v3 run: echo "💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner." run: echo "🖥️ The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner." name: List files in the repository run: | ls ${{ github.workspace }} run: echo "🍏 This job's status is ${{ job.status }}." Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file. Commit workflow file Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

Viewing your workflow results On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Under your repository name, click Actions. Actions tab in the main repository navigation

In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

Workflow list in left sidebar

From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

Name of workflow run

Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.

Locate job

The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

Example workflow results

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository: Example action detail

More starter workflows GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events. You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners. GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

Introduction You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML name: GitHub Actions Demo on: [push] jobs: Explore-GitHub-Actions: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps:

run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event." run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!" run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}." name: Check out repository code uses: actions/checkout@v3 run: echo "💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner." run: echo "🖥️ The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner." name: List files in the repository run: | ls ${{ github.workspace }} run: echo "🍏 This job's status is ${{ job.status }}." Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file. Commit workflow file Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

Viewing your workflow results On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Under your repository name, click Actions. Actions tab in the main repository navigation

In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

Workflow list in left sidebar

From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

Name of workflow run

Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.

Locate job

The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

Example workflow results

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository: Example action detail

More starter workflows GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events. You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners. GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started?

- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) & see if we [accept contributions](#types-of-contributions-memo) for your type of issue.

### Use the 'make a contribution' button

<img src="./assets/images/contribution_cta.png" width="400">

Navigating a new codebase can be challenging, so we're making that a little easier. As you're using docs.github.com, you may come across an article that you want to make an update to. You can click on the **make a contribution** button right on that article, which will take you to the file in this repo where you'll make your changes.

Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/) already for the change you want to make.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

**Note:** We cannot accept contributions to the [REST API reference documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference). If you spot an inaccuracy in the REST API reference documentation, open an issue in the [github/rest-api-description](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/issues/new?template=schema-inaccuracy.md) repository.

- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update. Here are some tips and tricks for [using the docs codebase](#working-in-the-githubdocs-repository).
  - Are you making changes to the application code? You'll need **Node.js v16** to run the site locally. See [contributing/development.md](contributing/development.md).
  - Are you contributing to markdown? We use [GitHub Markdown](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, use the [pull request template](#pull-request-template) to open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! The whole GitHub community thanks you. :sparkles:

Once your PR is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the [contributor chart](https://github.com/github/docs/graphs/contributors).

## Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute to the GitHub Docs content and site in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on docs.github.com! Our small, but mighty :muscle: docs team is maintaining this repo, to preserve our bandwidth, off topic conversations will be closed.

### :mega: Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/github/docs/discussions).

### :beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa: To learn more about opening a pull request in this repo, see [Opening a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request) below.

We cannot accept contributions to the [REST API reference documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference). If you spot an inaccuracy in the REST API reference documentation, open an issue in the [github/rest-api-description](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/issues/new?template=schema-inaccuracy.md) repository.

### :question: Support
We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with GitHub, unrelated to our documentation, please [contact GitHub Support directly](https://support.github.com/contact). Any issues, discussions, or pull requests opened here requesting support will be given information about how to contact GitHub Support, then closed and locked.

If you're having trouble with your GitHub account, contact [Support](https://support.github.com/contact).

### :earth_asia: Translations

This website is internationalized and available in multiple languages. The source content in this repository is written in English. We integrate with an external localization platform called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) and work with professional translators to localize the English content.

**We do not currently accept contributions for translated content**, but we hope to in the future.

### :balance_scale: Site Policy
GitHub's site policies are published on docs.github.com, too!

If you find a typo in the site policy section, you can open a pull request to fix it. For anything else, see [the CONTRIBUTING guide in the site-policy repo](https://github.com/github/site-policy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Starting with an issue
You can browse existing issues to find something that needs help!

### Labels
Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.
- The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
- The [`content` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acontent) is for problems or updates in the content on docs.github.com. These will usually require some knowledge of Markdown.
- The [`engineering` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aengineering) is for problems or updates in the docs.github.com website. These will usually require some knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js or YAML to fix.

## Opening a pull request
You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Working in the github/docs repository
Here's some information that might be helpful while working on a Docs PR:

- [Development](/contributing/development.md) - This short guide describes how to get this app running on your local machine.

- [Content markup reference](/contributing/content-markup-reference.md) - All of our content is written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, with some additional enhancements.

- [Content style guide for GitHub Docs](/contributing/content-style-guide.md) - This guide covers GitHub-specific information about how we style our content and images. It also links to the resources we use for general style guidelines.

- [Content model](/contributing/content-model.md) and [content templates](/contributing/content-templates.md) - The content model describes the purpose of each type of content we use in GitHub Docs and how to write for each type. The templates allow you to quickly get started with new articles.

- [Reusables](/data/reusables/README.md) - We use reusables to help us keep content up to date. Instead of writing the same long string of information in several articles, we create a reusable, then call it from the individual articles.

- [Variables](/data/variables/README.md) - We use variables the same way we use reusables. Variables are for short strings of reusable text.

- [Liquid](/contributing/liquid-helpers.md) - We use liquid helpers to create different versions of our content.

- [Scripts](/script/README.md) - The scripts directory is the home for all of the scripts you can run locally.

- [Tests](/tests/README.md) - We use tests to ensure content will render correctly on the site. Tests run automatically in your PR, and sometimes it's also helpful to run them locally.

## Reviewing
We (usually the docs team, but sometimes GitHub product managers, engineers, or supportocats too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use GitHub.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.  

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:
- [22/15] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [22/15] Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected. This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide, or content that isn't rendering due to versioning problems. Remember that lists and tables can be tricky.
- [22/15] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [22/15] Review the entire pull request using the [localization checklist](contributing/localization-checklist.md).
- [22/15] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the [style guide](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/content-style-guide.md).
- [22/15] Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct.
- [22/15] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Pull request template
When you open a pull request, you must fill out the "Ready for review" template before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.

### Suggested changes
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix based systems use `\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
1. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
1. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
