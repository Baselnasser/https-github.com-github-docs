Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can [contribute to the docs](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md).

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix-based systems use `\n`. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows
    - Skip to content

title: Heroku Deployment	
layout: en	
deploy: v1	

---	



Travis CI can automatically deploy your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) application after a successful build.	

To use the default configuration, add your encrypted Heroku api key to your `.travis.yml`:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key:	
    secure: "YOUR ENCRYPTED API KEY"	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

If you have both the [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and [Travis CI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#readme) command line clients installed, you can get your key, encrypt it and add it to your `.travis.yml` by running the following command from your project directory:	

```bash	
travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key	
```	

`travis` command defaults to using [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org) as the API endpoint. If your build runs on [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com) (even if your repository is public), add `--pro` flag to override this:	

```bash	
travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key --pro	
```	
You can also use the Travis CI command line setup tool `travis setup heroku`.	

## Deploying Custom Application Names	

By default, we will try to deploy to an application by the same name as the repository. For example, if you deploy an application from the GitHub repository [travis-ci/travis-chat](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-chat) without explicitly specify the name of the application, Travis CI will try to deploy to a Heroku app named *travis-chat*.	

You can explicitly set the name via the **app** option:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  app: my-app-123	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

It is also possible to deploy different branches to different applications:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  app:	
    master: my-app-staging	
    production: my-app-production	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

If these apps belong to different Heroku accounts, you will have to do the same for the API key:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key:	
    master: ...	
    production: ...	
  app:	
    master: my-app-staging	
    production: my-app-production	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

## Deploying Specific Branches	

If you have branch specific options, as [shown above](#deploying-custom-application-names), Travis CI will automatically figure out which branches to deploy from. Otherwise, it will only deploy from your **master** branch.	

You can also explicitly specify the branch to deploy from with the **on** option:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  on: production	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

Alternatively, you can also configure it to deploy from all branches:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  on:	
    all_branches: true	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

Builds triggered from Pull Requests will never trigger a deploy.	

## Running Commands	

In some setups, you might want to run a command on Heroku after a successful deploy. You can do this with the **run** option:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  run: "rake db:migrate"	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

It also accepts a list of commands:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  run:	
    - "rake db:migrate"	
    - "rake cleanup"	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

> Take note that Heroku app might not be completely deployed and ready to serve requests when we run your commands. To mitigate this situation, you can add a `sleep` statement to add a delay before your commands.	
### Error Logs for Custom Commands	

Custom Heroku commands do not affect the Travis CI build status or trigger Travis CI notifications.	

Use an addon such as [Papertrail](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/papertrail){: data-proofer-ignore=""} or [Logentries](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/logentries){: data-proofer-ignore=""} to get notifications for `rake db:migrate` or other commands.	

These add-ons have email notification systems that can be triggered when certain string matches occur in your Heroku logs. For example you could trigger an e-mail notification if the log contains "this and all later migrations canceled".	

### Restarting Applications	

Sometimes you want to restart your Heroku application between or after commands. You can easily do so by adding a "restart" command:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  run:	
    - "rake db:migrate"	
    - restart	
    - "rake cleanup"	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

## Deploying build artifacts	

After your tests ran and before the deploy, Travis CI will clean up any additional files and changes you made.	

Maybe that is not what you want, as you might generate some artifacts (think asset compilation) that are supposed to be deployed, too. There is now an option to skip the clean up:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  skip_cleanup: true	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

{% include conditional_deploy.html provider="heroku" %}	

### Deploy Strategy	

Travis CI supports different mechanisms for deploying to Heroku:	

- **api:** Uses Heroku's [Build API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-and-release-using-the-api). This is the default strategy.	
- **git:** Does a `git push` over HTTPS.	

It defaults to **api**, but you can change that via the **strategy** option:	

```yaml	
deploy:	
  provider: heroku	
  api_key: ...	
  strategy: git	
```	
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}	

#### Using `.gitignore` on `git` strategy	

When you use any of the `git` strategies, be mindful that the deployment will	
honor `.gitignore`.	

If your `.gitignore` file matches something that your build creates, use	
[`before_deploy`](#running-commands-before-and-after-deploy) to change	
its content.	

### Running commands before and after deploy	

Sometimes you want to run commands before or after deploying. You can use the `before_deploy` and `after_deploy` stages for this. These will only be triggered if Travis CI is actually deploying.	

```yaml	
before_deploy: "echo 'ready?'"	
deploy:	
  ..	
after_deploy:	
  - ./after_deploy_1.sh	
  - ./after_deploy_2.sh	
```

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, a broker-dealer subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., for fraudulently engaging in manipulative trading of U.S. Treasury securities. J.P. Morgan Securities admitted the findings in the SEC's order, and agreed to pay disgorgement of $10 million and a civil penalty of $25 million to settle the action.
The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced parallel actions against JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its affiliates for engaging in manipulative trading in the precious metals and U.S. Treasuries futures and cash markets. A total of more than $920 million, including amounts for criminal restitution, forfeiture, disgorgement, penalties, and fines, is to be paid across the three actions. The DOJ entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with JPMorgan Chase & Co., whereas the CFTC announced settlements with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Securities.
According to the SEC's order, between April 2015 and January 2016, certain traders on J.P. Morgan Securities' Treasuries trading desk employed manipulative trading strategies involving Treasury cash securities. The order finds that the traders placed bona fide orders to buy or sell a particular Treasury security, while nearly simultaneously placing non-bona fide orders, which the traders did not intend to execute, for the same series of Treasury security on the opposite side of the market. The order finds that the non-bona fide orders were intended to create a false appearance of buy or sell interest, which would induce other market participants to trade against the bona fide orders at prices that were more favorable to J.P. Morgan Securities than J.P. Morgan Securities otherwise would have been able to obtain. According to the order, after the traders secured beneficially priced executions for the bona fide orders, they promptly cancelled the non-bona fide orders.
"J.P. Morgan Securities undermined the integrity of our markets with this scheme," said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. "Their manipulative trading of Treasury cash securities created a false appearance of activity in the market and induced other market participants to trade at more favorable prices than J.P. Morgan Securities would have otherwise been able to obtain."
J.P. Morgan Securities agreed to the entry of an order in which it admitted to the SEC's factual findings and that its conduct violated Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. J.P. Morgan Securities was further ordered to cease and desist from future violations of Section 17(a), was censured, and was ordered to pay disgorgement of $10 million and a civil penalty of $25 million. The civil penalty ordered will be offset by amounts paid by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates in the parallel proceedings announced by the DOJ and the CFTC.
The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jessica T. Quinn and Thomas P. Smith, Jr., and supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, all of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the DOJ and the CFTC.

Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
 Me Zachry Tyler Wood III the indiciy 3 and code T I wasn’t supposed the do anything this year suppossedly and yet I’m dong more than ever trying to get my accounts back it’s stupid and I hate you.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that all of our directors, officers, employees and agents shall be entitled to be indemnified by us to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”).

Section 145 of the DGCL concerning indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents is set forth below.

Section 145. Indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents; insurance.



(a)
A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was unlawful.




(b)
A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.


II-1




(c)
To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.




(d)
Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.




(e)
Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former officers and directors or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.




(f)
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. A right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the certificate of incorporation or a bylaw shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to such provision after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought, unless the provision in effect at the time of such act or omission explicitly authorizes such elimination or impairment after such action or omission has occurred.




(g)
A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this section.




(h)
For purposes of this section, references to “the corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.


II-2




(i)
For purposes of this section, references to “other enterprises” shall include employee benefit plans; references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to “serving at the request of the corporation” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the corporation” as referred to in this section.




(j)
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.




(k)
The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification brought under this section or under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Court of Chancery may summarily determine a corporation’s obligation to advance expenses (including attorneys’ fees).


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers, and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in a successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to the court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

In accordance with Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that no director shall be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages resulting from breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such limitation on or exemption from liability is not permitted under the DGCL. The effect of this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is to eliminate our rights and those of our stockholders (through stockholders’ derivative suits on our behalf) to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of the fiduciary duty of care as a director, including breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior, except, as restricted by Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL. However, this provision does not limit or eliminate our rights or the rights of any stockholder to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director’s duty of care.

If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the liability of directors, then, in accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the liability of our directors to us or our stockholders will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation limiting or eliminating the liability of directors, whether by our stockholders or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless otherwise required by law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us to further limit or eliminate the liability of directors on a retroactive basis.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also provide that we will, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, indemnify our current and former officers and directors, as well as those persons who, while directors or officers of our corporation, are or were serving as directors, officers, employees or agents of another entity, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, in connection with any threatened, pending or completed proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorney’s fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by any such person in connection with any such proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person eligible for indemnification pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will be indemnified by us in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person only if such proceeding was authorized by our board of directors, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification.

II-3


The right to indemnification conferred by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is a contract right that includes the right to be paid by us the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding referenced above in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by our officer or director (solely in the capacity as an officer or director of our corporation) will be made only upon delivery to us of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such officer or director, to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or otherwise.

The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which any person covered by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have or hereafter acquire under law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation affecting indemnification rights, whether by our stockholders or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless otherwise required by law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis, and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also permit us, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than those specifically covered by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

Our bylaws include provisions relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights consistent with those set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In addition, our bylaws provide for a right of indemnity to bring a suit in the event a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses is not paid in full by us within a specified period of time. Our bylaws also permit us to purchase and maintain insurance, at our expense, to protect us and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of our corporation or another entity, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not we would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our bylaws affecting indemnification rights, whether by our board of directors, stockholders or by changes in applicable law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless otherwise required by law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis, and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

We will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors a form of which is filed as an exhibit to this registration statement. These agreements will require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified.

Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement, we have agreed to indemnify the underwriters and the underwriters have agreed to indemnify us against certain civil liabilities that may be incurred in connection with this offering, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act.

Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.

In July 2020, Jupiter Founders LLC, our sponsor, and Messrs. Robert Knox, William Pate and George Pita, our independent director nominees, purchased from us, prior to the consummation of this offering, an aggregate of 5,750,00 shares of Class B common stock, or founder shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share, in a private placement. Such securities were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

II-4


In addition, our sponsor and the underwriters have committed to purchase an aggregate of 600,000 units (or 660,000 units if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), at $10.00 per unit ($6,000,000 in the aggregate, or $6,600,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). This purchase will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering. This issuance will be made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

Our initial stockholders are accredited investors for purposes of Rule 501 of Regulation D. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales.

Item 17. Undertakings.



(a)
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriter at the closing specified in the underwriting agreements, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.




(b)
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.




(c)
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:




(1)
To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:




(i)
To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




(ii)
To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement;




(iii)
To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.




(2)
For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.




(3)
To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.




(4)
For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


II-6




(5)
For the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, if the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.




(6)
For the purpose of determining liability of a registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of an undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:




(i)
Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;




(ii)
Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by an undersigned registrant;




(iii)
The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




(iv)
Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Jupiter Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), proposes to issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the “Underwriters”), for whom you are acting as representative (the “Representative”), an aggregate of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”) of the Company (the “Underwritten Securities”). The Company also proposes to grant to the Underwriters an option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Option Securities”; the Option Securities, together with the Underwritten Securities, being hereinafter called the “Securities”).

Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Warrant(s)”). The shares of Common Stock (the “Public Shares”) and Warrants included in the Units will not trade separately until the 52nd day following the date of the Prospectus (as defined below) (unless the Representative informs the Company of its decision to allow earlier separate trading), subject to (a) the Company’s preparation of an audited balance sheet reflecting the receipt by the Company of the proceeds of the offering of the Securities, (b) the filing of such audited balance sheet with the Commission on a Form 8-K or similar form by the Company that includes such audited balance sheet, and (c) the Company having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Each whole Warrant entitles its holder, upon exercise, to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share during the period commencing on the later of thirty (30) days after the completion by the Company of an initial Business Combination (as defined below) or twelve (12) months from the date of the consummation of the Offering (as defined below) and terminating on the five-year anniversary of the date of the completion of such initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or Liquidation (as defined below). As used herein, the term “Business Combination” (as described more fully in the Registration Statement (as defined below)) shall mean a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.

The Company has entered into an Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated the date hereof, with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (“CST”), as trustee, in substantially the form filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Registration Statement (the “Trust Agreement”), pursuant to which certain proceeds from the sale of the Private Units (as defined below) and the proceeds of the Offering will be deposited and held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) for the benefit of the Company, the Underwriters and the holders of the Underwritten Securities and the Option Securities, if and when issued.




The Company has entered into a Warrant Agreement, dated the date hereof, 2020, with respect to the Warrants with CST, as warrant agent, in substantially the form filed as Exhibit 4.4 to the Registration Statement (the “Warrant Agreement”), pursuant to which CST will act as warrant agent in connection with the issuance, registration, transfer, exchange, redemption, and exercise of the Warrants.

The Company has entered into a Founder Shares Subscription Agreement, dated as of July 7, 2020, with each of Jupiter Founders LLC (the “Sponsor”), Robert A. Knox, George L. Pita, and William Pate (each, a “Subscription Agreement” and collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) for the sale of an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of Class B common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”), for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, of which up to 750,000 are subject to forfeiture if the Underwriters do not exercise their right to purchase Option Securities. Certain of the Underwriters and certain of their employees purchased from the Sponsor an aggregate of 536,667 Founder Shares (up to 70,000 shares of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised) at the Sponsor’s original purchase price. Among the 536,667 Founder Shares, 191,667 shares (up to 25,000 shares of which are subject to forfeiture) were purchased by Nomura Securities International, Inc. (“Nomura”), 172,500 shares (up to 22,500 shares of which are subject to forfeiture) were purchased by certain employees of Brookline Capital Markets, a division of Arcadia Securities, LLC (“Brookline”), and 172,500 shares (up to 22,500 shares of which are subject to forfeiture) were purchased by Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. (“Ladenburg”) and certain of its employees.

The Company has entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as of date hereof (the “Sponsor Unit Subscription Agreement”), with the Sponsor, in substantially the form filed as Exhibit 10.7 to the Registration Statement. Pursuant to the Sponsor Unit Subscription Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to purchase an aggregate of 446,000 units (or 482,900 units if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) (the “Sponsor Private Placement Units”), each unit consisting of one share of Common Stock (the “Sponsor Private Shares”) and one-half of one Warrant (the “Sponsor Private Warrants”), for $10.00 per Sponsor Private Placement Unit in a private placement closing simultaneously with the closing of the Offering and intended to be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Act. The Sponsor Private Placement Units are substantially similar to the Units, except as described in the Prospectus.

- 5 - 


(d) The Company hereby agrees to pay to the Underwriters a deferred discount of $0.35 per Unit of the Option Securities purchased hereunder (the “Option Deferred Discount” and together with the Underwritten Deferred Discount, the “Deferred Discount”), which Option Deferred Discount will be deposited and held in the Trust Account and payable directly from the Trust Account, without accrued interest, to the Representative upon consummation of the Business Combination.

(f) If the option provided for in Section 1(c) hereof is exercised after the second Business Day prior to the Time of Purchase, the Company will deliver the Option Securities (at the expense of the Company) to the Representative, at Worldwide Plaza, 309 West 49th Street, New York, New York 10019-7316 on the date specified by the Representative (which shall be at least two Business Days after exercise of said option) for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representative of the purchase price thereof. If settlement for the Option Securities occurs after the Time of Purchase, the Company will deliver to the Representative on the settlement date for the Option Securities (an “Option Securities Settlement Date”), and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Option Securities shall be conditioned upon receipt of, supplemental opinions, certificates and letters confirming as of such date the opinions, certificates and letters delivered pursuant to Section 5 hereof.

(z) During the period prior to the Company’s initial Business Combination or Liquidation, the Company may instruct the trustee under the Trust Agreement to release from the Trust Account, solely from interest income earned on the funds held in the Trust Account, the amounts necessary to pay taxes. Otherwise, all funds held in the Trust Account (including any interest income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable)) will remain in the Trust Account until the earlier of the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination or the Liquidation; provided, however, that in the event of the Liquidation, up to $100,000 of interest income may be released to the Company if the proceeds of the Offering held outside of the Trust Account are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing the Company’s plan of dissolution.

(aa) The Company will reserve and keep available that maximum number of its authorized but unissued securities that are issuable upon exercise of any of the Warrants and Private Warrants outstanding from time to time.

(bb)  Prior to the consummation of a Business Combination or the Liquidation, the Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock, Warrants or any options or other securities convertible into Common Stock, or any shares of preferred stock, in each case, that participate in any manner in the Trust Account or that vote as a class with the Common Stock on a Business Combination.

(cc) Prior to the consummation of a Business Combination or the Liquidation, the Company’s audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments made to the Sponsor, to the Company’s officers or directors, or to the Company’s or any of such other persons’ respective affiliates.

(dd) The Company agrees that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the Company from becoming subject to Rule 419 under the Act prior to the consummation of any Business Combination, including, but not limited to, using its best efforts to prevent any of the Company’s outstanding securities from being deemed to be a “penny stock” as defined in Rule 3a-51-1 under the Exchange Act during such period.

(ee) To the extent required by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, the Company will maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary in order to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences

(ff) As soon as legally required to do so, the Company and its directors and officers, in their capacities as such, shall take all actions necessary to comply with any provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including Section 402 related to loans and Sections 302 and 906 related to certifications, and to comply with the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules.

(gg) Prior to the consummation of a Business Combination or the Liquidation, the Company shall not take any action or omit to take any action that would cause the Company to be in breach or violation of its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or its Bylaws, as amended.

(hh) Prior to the consummation of a Business Combination or the Liquidation, the Company will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than its independent auditors), prospective target businesses, lenders or other entities with which it does business enter into agreements waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of the Public Stockholders.

(ii) The Company may consummate the initial Business Combination and conduct redemptions of shares of Common Stock for cash upon consummation of such Business Combination without a stockholder vote pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, including the filing of tender offer documents with the Commission. Such tender offer documents will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under the Commission’s proxy rules and will provide each stockholder of the Company with the opportunity prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination to redeem the shares of Common Stock held by such stockholder for an amount of cash equal to (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account representing (x) the proceeds held in the Trust Account from the Offering and the sale of the Private Units and (y) any interest income earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses)), divided by (B) the total number of Public Shares then outstanding. If, however, the Company elects not to file such tender offer documents, a stockholder vote is required by law in connection with the initial Business Combination, or the Company decides to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will submit such Business Combination to the Company’s stockholders for their approval (“Business Combination Vote”). With respect to the initial Business Combination Vote, if any, the Sponsor has agreed to vote all of the Founder Shares and any other shares of Common Stock purchased during or after the Offering in favor of the Company’s initial Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination, the Company will offer to each Public Stockholder holding shares of Common Stock the right to have its shares redeemed in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules of the Commission at a per share redemption price (the “Redemption Price”) equal to (I) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account representing (1) the proceeds held in the Trust Account from the Offering and the sale of the Private Units and (2) any interest income earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses)), divided by (II) the total number of Public Shares then outstanding. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination, the Company may proceed with such Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares voted by the stockholders at a duly-held stockholders meeting are voted to approve such Business Combination. If, after seeking and receiving such stockholder approval, the Company elects to so proceed, it will redeem shares, at the Redemption Price, from those Public Stockholders who affirmatively requested such redemption. Only Public Stockholders holding shares of Common Stock who properly exercise their redemption rights, in accordance with the applicable tender offer or proxy materials related to such Business Combination, shall be entitled to receive distributions from the Trust Account in connection with an initial Business Combination, and the Company shall pay no distributions with respect to any other holders or shares of capital stock of the Company in connection therewith. In the event that the Company does not effect a Business Combination by twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the Offering (or such longer period as may be approved by the Company’s stockholders), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Only Public Stockholders holding shares of Common Stock included in the Securities shall be entitled to receive such redemption amounts and the Company shall pay no such redemption amounts or any distributions in liquidation with respect to any other shares of capital stock of the Company. The Company will not propose any amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares if the Company has not consummated a Business Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the Offering, as described in Section 9.2(d) of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation unless the Company offers the right to redeem the Public Shares in connection with such amendment.

- 26 - 


(jj) In the event that the Company desires or is required by an applicable law or regulation to cause an announcement (“Business Combination Announcement”) to be placed in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times or any other news or media publication or outlet or to be made via a public filing with the Commission announcing the consummation of the Business Combination that indicates that the Underwriters were the underwriters in the Offering, the Company shall supply the Representative with a draft of the Business Combination Announcement and provide the Representative with a reasonable advance opportunity to comment thereon, subject to the agreement of the Underwriters to keep confidential such draft announcement in accordance with the Representative’s standard policies regarding confidential information.

(kk) Upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the Company will pay to the Representative, on behalf of the Underwriters, the Deferred Discount, including the Option Deferred Discount, if applicable. Payment of the Deferred Discount will be made out of the proceeds of this offering held in the Trust Account. The Underwriters shall have no claim to payment of any interest earned on the portion of the proceeds held in the Trust Account representing the Deferred Discount. If the Company fails to consummate its initial Business Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the Offering, the Deferred Discount will not be paid to the Representative and will, instead, be included in the Liquidation distribution of the proceeds held in the Trust Account made to the Public Stockholders. In connection with any such Liquidation, the Underwriters forfeit any rights or claims to the Deferred Discount.

(mm) The Trust Agreement shall provide that the trustee is required to obtain a joint written instruction signed by each of the Company and the Representative with respect to the transfer of the funds held in the Trust Account from the Trust Account prior to commencing any liquidation of the assets of the Trust Account in connection with the consummation of any Business Combination, and such provision of the Trust Agreement shall not be permitted to be amended without the prior written consent of the Representative.

4. Covenant to Pay Costs. (a) The Company agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, all costs, expenses, fees and taxes in connection with (i) the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, and the printing and furnishing of copies of each thereof to the Underwriters (including costs of mailing and shipment), (ii) the printing, registration, issue, sale and delivery of the Securities and the Private Units, including any stock or transfer taxes and stamp or similar duties payable upon the registration, sale, issuance or delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters, (iii) the producing, word processing and/or printing of this Agreement, any Agreement Among Underwriters, any dealer agreements, any closing documents (including compilations thereof) and such other documents as may be required in connection with the offering, purchase, sale, issuance or delivery of the Securities, and the reproduction and/or printing and furnishing of copies of each thereof to the Underwriters (including costs of mailing and shipment), (iv) the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under state or non-U.S. laws and the determination of their eligibility for investment under state or non-U.S. law (including the legal fees and filing fees and other disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters) and the printing and furnishing of copies of any blue sky surveys or legal investment surveys to the Underwriters, (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the Securities on Nasdaq and any registration thereof under the Exchange Act, (vi) the filing for review of the public offering of the Securities by FINRA, including the legal fees and filing fees and other disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters relating to FINRA matters (not to exceed $50,000), (vii) the fees and disbursements of the transfer agent and registrar for the Securities, (viii) the costs and expenses relating to presentations or meetings undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Securities to prospective investors and the Underwriters’ respective sales forces, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations, travel, lodging and other expenses incurred by the officers of the Company, other representatives of the Company, representatives of the Underwriters (not to exceed $10,000) and any such consultants; (ix) fees, expenses and disbursements relating to background checks of the Company’s directors and management team (not to exceed $35,000 in the aggregate); and (x) the performance of the Company’s other obligations hereunder.

- 32 - 


(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers, and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any and all loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) whatsoever, as incurred, which, jointly or severally, the Company or any such person may incur insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim primarily and directly arises out of, relates to or is based on (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with Underwriter Information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by such Underwriter to the Representative for delivery to the Company expressly for use in, the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or primarily and directly arises out of, relates to or is based on any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) in connection with such Underwriter Information, which material fact was not contained in such Underwriter Information and which material fact was required to be stated in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with Underwriter Information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by such Underwriter to the Representative for delivery to the Company expressly for use in, any preliminary prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or primarily and directly arises out of, relates to or is based on any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in any preliminary prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in connection with such Underwriter Information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a “Proceeding”) is brought against a person (an “indemnified party”) in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any party required to provide indemnification under this Agreement (as applicable, the “indemnifying party”), such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding; provided, however, that the omission or failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall any indemnifying party shall be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding or Proceedings; provided, however, that, if indemnity is sought pursuant to Section 8(d) hereof then, in addition to the fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of not more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from its own counsel. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any and all loss, damage, expense, liability or claim by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days’ prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.

- 33 - 


(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under the applicable subsections above or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any and all losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering of the Securities (net of underwriting discounts received by the Underwriters but before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the underwriting discounts received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.

For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each of the Underwriter’s partners, directors, officers, members and affiliates shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter; and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

(e) Each of the Company and the Underwriters agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(e) hereof. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total underwriting discounts received by such Underwriter in connection with Securities underwritten by it for sale to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.

(f) The provisions contained in this Section 8, as well as the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors, officers members or affiliates or any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, the Company’s directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the sale and delivery of the Securities. The Company agrees promptly to notify the Underwriters of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company’s directors or officers in connection with the sale and delivery of the Securities or with the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.

9. Information Furnished by the Underwriters. The statements set forth under the caption “Underwriting” in the Prospectus, only insofar as such statements relate to the amount of selling concession and reallowance or to the stabilization activities that may be undertaken by the Underwriters, constitute the only “Underwriter Information” for purposes hereof.

10. Notices. Except as otherwise herein provided, all statements, requests, notices and agreements shall be in writing or by telegram, facsimile and, if to the Underwriters, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent to them c/o Nomura Securities International, Inc., Worldwide Plaza, 309 West 49th Street, New York, New York 10019-7316, Attention:” Head of US ECMS: James Chenard (e-mail: james.chenard@nomura.com), with a copy to the Head of IBD Legal: Oliver Trumbo (e-mail:oliver.trumbo@nomura.com); and if to the Company, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent to the Company at the offices of the Company at 11450 SE Dixie Hwy, Hobe Sound, FL 33455, Attention: James N Hauslein, with a copy to Greenberg Traurig, P.A., 333 S.E. 2nd Avenue, Miami, FL 33131, Attention: Alan I.

The section headings in this Agreement have been inserted as a matter of convenience of reference and are not a part of this Agreement.

12. Submission to Jurisdiction. Except as set forth below, no Claim may be commenced, prosecuted or continued in any court other than the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the adjudication of such matters, and the Company consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and personal service with respect thereto. The Company consents to personal jurisdiction, service and venue in any court in which any Claim arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement is brought by any third party against any Underwriter or any indemnified party. Each of the Underwriters and the Company (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The Company agrees that a final judgment in any such action, proceeding or counterclaim brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company and may be enforced in any other courts to the jurisdiction of which the Company is or may be subject by suit upon such judgment.

No other person, partnership, association or corporation (including a purchaser of Securities, as such purchaser, from any of the Underwriters) shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.

14. No Fiduciary Relationship. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely as underwriters in connection with the purchase and sale of the Securities. The Company further acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm’s length basis, and in no event do the parties intend that the Underwriters act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Company, its management, stockholders or other equity owners or creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that the Underwriters may undertake or have undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Securities, either before or after the date hereof. The Underwriters hereby expressly disclaim any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Company, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and the Company confirms its understanding and agreement to that effect. The Company agrees that it is responsible for making its own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions and that any opinions or views expressed by any Underwriter to the Company regarding such transactions, including, but not limited to, any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to the Company. The Company agrees that the Underwriters are not acting as fiduciary of the Company and no Underwriter has assumed or will assume any advisory responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters). The Company waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary, advisory or similar duty to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions.

15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed by the parties in one or more counterparts which together shall constitute one and the same agreement among the parties.

Warrant Certificate

This Warrant Certificate certifies that __________, or its registered assigns, is the registered holder of __________ warrant(s) evidenced hereby (the “Warrants” and each, a “Warrant”) to purchase shares of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), of Jupiter Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Each Warrant entitles the holder, upon exercise during the period set forth in the Warrant Agreement referred to below, to receive from the Company that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock as set forth below, at the exercise price (the “Exercise Price”) as determined pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, payable in lawful money (or through “cashless exercise” as provided for in the Warrant Agreement) of the United States of America upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate and payment of the Exercise Price at the office or agency of the Warrant Agent referred to below, subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement. Defined terms used in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Warrant Agreement.

Each whole Warrant is initially exercisable for one fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of any Warrant. If, upon the exercise of Warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the Company will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Warrant holder. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

The initial Exercise Price per share of Common Stock for any Warrant is equal to $11.50 per share. The Exercise Price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

Subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement, the Warrants may be exercised only during the Exercise Period and to the extent not exercised by the end of such Exercise Period, such Warrants shall become void. The Warrants may be redeemed, subject to certain conditions, as set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Warrant Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof and such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.

This Warrant Certificate shall not be valid unless countersigned by the Warrant Agent, as such term is used in the Warrant Agreement.

This Warrant Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.

[Form of Warrant Certificate]

[Reverse]

The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are part of a duly authorized issue of Warrants entitling the holder on exercise to receive shares of Common Stock and are issued or to be issued pursuant to a Warrant Agreement dated as of __________, 2020 (the “Warrant Agreement”), duly executed and delivered by the Company to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, a New York limited purpose trust company, as warrant agent (the “Warrant Agent”), which Warrant Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference in and made a part of this instrument and is hereby referred to for a description of the rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company and the holders (the words “holders” or “holder” meaning the Registered Holders or Registered Holder, respectively) of the Warrants. A copy of the Warrant Agreement may be obtained by the holder hereof upon written request to the Company. Defined terms used in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Warrant Agreement.

Warrants may be exercised at any time during the Exercise Period set forth in the Warrant Agreement. The holder of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may exercise them by surrendering this Warrant Certificate, with the form of election to purchase set forth hereon properly completed and executed, together with payment of the Exercise Price as specified in the Warrant Agreement (or through “cashless exercise” as provided for in the Warrant Agreement) at the principal corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent. In the event that upon any exercise of Warrants evidenced hereby the number of Warrants exercised shall be less than the total number of Warrants evidenced hereby, there shall be issued to the holder hereof or his, her or its assignee, a new Warrant Certificate evidencing the number of Warrants not exercised.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Warrant Certificate or the Warrant Agreement, no Warrant may be exercised unless at the time of exercise (i) a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise is effective under the Securities Act and (ii) a prospectus thereunder relating to the shares of Common Stock is current, except through “cashless exercise” as provided for in the Warrant Agreement.

The Warrant Agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants set forth on the face hereof may, subject to certain conditions, be adjusted. If, upon exercise of a Warrant, the holder thereof would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the Company shall, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the holder of the Warrant.

Warrant Certificates, when surrendered at the principal corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent by the Registered Holder thereof in person or by legal representative or attorney duly authorized in writing, may be exchanged, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, but without payment of any service charge, for another Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor evidencing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants.

Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of this Warrant Certificate at the office of the Warrant Agent a new Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants shall be issued to the transferee(s) in exchange for this Warrant Certificate, subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the Registered Holder(s) hereof as the absolute owner(s) of this Warrant Certificate (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone), for the purpose of any exercise hereof, of any distribution to the holder(s) hereof, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the Warrants nor this Warrant Certificate entitles any holder hereof to any rights of a stockholder of the Company.

This letter (this “Letter Agreement”) is being delivered to you in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) to be entered into by and between Jupiter Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and Nomura Securities International, Inc., as representative (the “Representative”) of the several underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the “Underwriters”), relating to an underwritten initial public offering (the “Public Offering”), of 23,000,000 of the Company’s units (including up to 3,000,000 units that may be purchased to cover over-allotments, if any) (each, a “Unit”), each Unit comprised of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (each, a “Warrant”). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units shall be sold in the Public Offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 and prospectus (the “Prospectus”) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) and the Company shall apply to have the Units listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in paragraph 10 hereof.

In order to induce the Company and the Underwriters to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and to proceed with the Public Offering and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Jupiter Founders LLC (the “Sponsor”), Nomura Securities International, Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. and each of the other Initial Stockholders, and each of the undersigned individuals, each of whom is a member of the Company’s board of directors and/or management team (each such other undersigned individual, an “Insider” and collectively, the “Insiders”), hereby agrees with the Company as follows:

1. The Sponsor, each Insider and each of the other Initial Stockholders agrees that (a) if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination, then in connection with such proposed Business Combination, it, he or she shall (i) vote any shares of Common Stock owned by it, him or her in favor of any proposed Business Combination and (ii) not redeem any shares of Common Stock owned by it, him or her in connection with such stockholder approval; and (b) if the Company engages in a tender offer in connection with a proposed Business Combination, it, he or she shall not sell any shares of Common Stock to the Company in connection therewith.

2. The Sponsor, each Insider and each of the other Initial Stockholders hereby agrees that in the event that the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination within 24 months from the date of the closing of the Public Offering (the latest such date being referred to as the “Termination Date”), or such longer period approved by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), the Sponsor, each Insider and each of the other Initial Stockholders shall take all reasonable steps to cause the Company to (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the Class A Common Stock sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering (the “Offering Shares”), at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Offering Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish all Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. The Sponsor, each Insider and each of the other Initial Stockholders agrees not to propose any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Offering Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination by the Termination Date or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides its Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Offering Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) earned on the funds in the Trust Account divided by the number of then outstanding Offering Shares.




The Sponsor, each Insider and each of the other Initial Stockholders acknowledges that it, he or she has no right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or any other asset of the Company as a result of any liquidation of the Company with respect to the Founder Shares held by it, him or her, provided, that the foregoing waiver shall not apply with respect to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account made in connection with any Offering Shares purchased by the undersigned or its affiliates during the Public Offering or on the open market after the completion of the Public Offering if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination by the Termination Date. The Sponsor, each Insider and each of the other Initial Stockholders hereby further waives, with respect to any shares of Common Stock held by it, him or her, if any, any redemption rights it, he or she may have in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination, including, without limitation, any such rights available in the context of a stockholder vote to approve such Business Combination or in the context of a tender offer made by the Company to purchase shares of Common Stock (although the Sponsor, the Insiders, the other Initial Stockholders and their respective affiliates shall be entitled to redemption and liquidation rights with respect to any Offering Shares it or they hold if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination by the Termination Date).

3. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in paragraphs 6(a) and (b) below, during the period commencing on the effective date of the Underwriting Agreement and ending 180 days after such date, the Sponsor, each Insider and each of the other Initial Stockholders shall not, without the prior written consent of the Representative, (i) offer, sell, contract to sell, hypothecate, pledge or grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction that is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise)), directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder, with respect to, any Units, shares of Common Stock, Warrants or any securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, Common Stock, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Units, shares of Common Stock, Warrants or any securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, shares of Common Stock owned by it, him or her, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or (iii) publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction. The provisions of this paragraph will not apply if (i) the release or waiver is effected solely to permit a transfer of securities that is not for consideration and (ii) the transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the same terms described in this Letter Agreement to the extent and for the duration that such terms remain in effect at the time of the transfer.

4. In the event of the liquidation of the Trust Account, the Sponsor (which for purposes of clarification shall not extend to any other members or managers of the Sponsor) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, whether pending or threatened, or any claim whatsoever) to which the Company may become subject as a result of any claim by (i) any third party (other than the Company’s independent accountants) for services rendered or products sold to the Company or (ii) a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement (a “Target”); provided, however, that such indemnification of the Company by the Sponsor shall apply only to the extent necessary to ensure that such claims by a third party for services rendered (other than the Company’s independent public accountants) or products sold to the Company or a Target do not reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.00 per share of the Offering Shares or (ii) such lesser amount per share of the Offering Shares held in the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, in each case, net of the amount of interest earned on the property in the Trust Account which may be withdrawn to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), except as to any claims by a third party (including a Target) who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In the event that any such executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against such third party, the Sponsor shall not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. The Sponsor shall have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Company if, within 15 days following written receipt of notice of the claim to the Sponsor, the Sponsor notifies the Company in writing that it shall undertake such defense.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Subscriber hereby agree as follows:

1. Agreement to Subscribe.

1.1 Purchase and Issuance of the Private Placement Units. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement:

(a) The Subscriber hereby agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to sell to the Subscriber, on the Initial Closing Date (as defined below) 446,000 Private Placement Units (the “Initial Private Placement Units”), for $10.00 per Initial Private Placement Unit, payable by the Subscriber by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by such other method as may be reasonably acceptable to the Company as follows: (i) $2,460,000 to the trust account (the “Trust Account”) at a financial institution to be chosen by the Company, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (“Continental”), at least one (1) business day prior to the Initial Closing Date, and (ii) $2,000,000 to the Company, at a financial institution to be chosen by the Company, on the Initial Closing Date.

2. Representations and Warranties of the Subscriber.

The Subscriber represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

2.1 Organization and Authority. The Subscriber is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and it possesses all requisite power and authority necessary to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.2 Authority. This Agreement has been validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Subscriber and is a valid and binding agreement of the Subscriber, enforceable against the Subscriber in accordance with its terms, subject to the general principles of equity and to bankruptcy or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally.

2.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation by the Subscriber of the transactions contemplated hereby do not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) the Subscriber’s organizational documents, (ii) any material agreement or instrument to which the Subscriber is a party or (iii) any law, statute, rule or regulation to which the Subscriber is subject, or any agreement, order, judgment or decree to which the Subscriber is subject.

2.4 Accredited Investor. The Subscriber represents that it is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and acknowledges that the sale contemplated hereby is being made in reliance, among other things, on a private placement exemption to “accredited investors” under the Securities Act and similar exemptions under state law.

2.5 Intent. The Subscriber is purchasing the Securities solely for investment purposes, for the Subscriber’s own account (and/or for the account or benefit of its members or affiliates, as permitted, pursuant to the terms hereof), and not with a view to the distribution thereof and the Subscriber has no present arrangement to sell the Securities to or through any person or entity except as may be permitted hereunder.

2.6 Restrictions on Transfer. The Subscriber acknowledges and understands the Securities are being offered in a transaction not involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act. The Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act, (ii) pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, if available, or (iii) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction.

 3



2.7 Sophisticated Investor.

(a) The Subscriber is sophisticated in financial matters and is able to evaluate the risks and benefits of the investment in the Securities.

(b) The Subscriber is aware that an investment in the Securities is highly speculative and subject to substantial risks because, among other things, (i) the Securities are subject to transfer restrictions and have not been registered under the Securities Act and therefore cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available and (ii) the Subscriber has waived its redemption rights with respect to the Private Shares as set forth in Section 5 hereof, and the Securities held by the Subscriber are not entitled to, and have no right, interest or claim to any monies held in the Trust Account, and the Subscriber may suffer a loss of a portion or all of its investment in the Securities. The Subscriber is able to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period of time.

2.8 Reliance on Representations and Warranties. The Subscriber understands the Private Placement Units are being offered and sold to the Subscriber in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and analogous provisions in the laws and regulations of various states, and that the Company is relying upon the truth and accuracy of the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of the Subscriber set forth in this Agreement in order to determine the applicability of such provisions.

2.9 No General Solicitation. The Subscriber is not subscribing for the Private Placement Units as a result of or subsequent to any general solicitation or general advertising, including but not limited to any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine, or similar media or broadcast over television or radio, or presented at any seminar or meeting or in the Registration Statement.

2.10 Legend. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees the book-entries or certificates, if any, evidencing each of the Securities shall bear a restrictive legend (the “Legend”), in form and substance substantially as set forth in Section 4 hereof.

3. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Company.

The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Subscriber that:

3.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power to own its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Subscriber hereby agree as follows:

1. Agreement to Subscribe.

1.1 Purchase and Issuance of the Private Placement Units. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement:

(a) The Subscriber hereby agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to sell to the Subscriber, on the Initial Closing Date (as defined below) the Private Placement Units set forth opposite the Subscriber’s name on Schedule I hereto (the “Initial Private Placement Units”), for $10.00 per Initial Private Placement Unit, payable by the Subscriber at least one (1) business day prior to the Initial Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by such other method as may be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to the trust account (the “Trust Account”) at a financial institution to be chosen by the Company, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (“Continental”).

The closing of the purchase and sale of the Private Placement Units shall take place at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166, or such other place as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto.

1.3 Conditions to Closing. The obligation of the Subscriber to purchase and pay for the Private Placement Units as provided herein shall be subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Underwriting Agreement”), by and between the Company and Nomura Securities International, Inc., as representative of the several underwriters named therein.

2


1.4 Termination. This Agreement and each of the obligations of the undersigned shall be null and void and without effect if the Initial Closing Date does not occur on prior to December 31, 2020 or if the Underwriting Agreement is terminated for any reason.

2. Representations and Warranties of the Subscriber.

The Subscriber represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

2.1 Organization and Authority. The Subscriber is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and it possesses all requisite power and authority necessary to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.2 Authority. This Agreement has been validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Subscriber and is a valid and binding agreement of the Subscriber, enforceable against the Subscriber in accordance with its terms, subject to the general principles of equity and to bankruptcy or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally.

2.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation by the Subscriber of the transactions contemplated hereby do not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) the Subscriber’s organizational documents, (ii) any material agreement or instrument to which the Subscriber is a party or (iii) any law, statute, rule or regulation to which the Subscriber is subject, or any agreement, order, judgment or decree to which the Subscriber is subject.

2.4 Accredited Investor. The Subscriber represents that it is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and acknowledges that the sale contemplated hereby is being made in reliance, among other things, on a private placement exemption to “accredited investors” under the Securities Act and similar exemptions under state law.

2.5 Intent. The Subscriber is purchasing the Securities solely for investment purposes, for the Subscriber’s own account (and/or for the account or benefit of its members or affiliates, as permitted, pursuant to the terms hereof), and not with a view to the distribution thereof and the Subscriber has no present arrangement to sell the Securities to or through any person or entity except as may be permitted hereunder.

2.6 Restrictions on Transfer. The Subscriber acknowledges and understands the Securities are being offered in a transaction not involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act.

3

(b) The Subscriber is aware that an investment in the Securities is highly speculative and subject to substantial risks because, among other things, (i) the Securities are subject to transfer restrictions and have not been registered under the Securities Act and therefore cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available and (ii) the Subscriber has waived its redemption rights with respect to the Private Shares as set forth in Section 5 hereof, and the Securities held by the Subscriber are not entitled to, and have no right, interest or claim to any monies held in the Trust Account, and the Subscriber may suffer a loss of a portion or all of its investment in the Securities. The Subscriber is able to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period of time.

2.8 Reliance on Representations and Warranties. The Subscriber understands the Private Placement Units are being offered and sold to the Subscriber in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and analogous provisions in the laws and regulations of various states, and that the Company is relying upon the truth and accuracy of the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of the Subscriber set forth in this Agreement in order to determine the applicability of such provisions.

2.9 No General Solicitation. The Subscriber is not subscribing for the Private Placement Units as a result of or subsequent to any general solicitation or general advertising, including but not limited to any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine, or similar media or broadcast over television or radio, or presented at any seminar or meeting or in the Registration Statement.

3.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby do not (i) result in a violation of the Company’s certificate of incorporation or by-laws, (ii) conflict with, or constitute a default under any agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or (iii) any law statute, rule or regulation to which the Company is subject or any agreement, order, judgment or decree to which the Company is subject.

Exhibit 14

CODE OF ETHICS
OF
JUPITER ACQUISITION CORPORATION



1.
Introduction


The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Jupiter Acquisition Corporation has adopted this code of ethics (this “Code”), as amended from time to time by the Board and which is applicable to all of the Company’s directors, officers and employees to:



●
promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;




●
promote the full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as well as in other public communications made by or on behalf of the Company;




●
promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;




●
deter wrongdoing; and




●
require prompt internal reporting of breaches of, and accountability for adherence to, this Code.


This Code may be amended and modified by the Board. In this Code, references to the “Company” mean Jupiter Acquisition Corporation, and, in appropriate context, the Company’s subsidiaries, if any.



2.
Honest, Ethical and Fair Conduct


Each person owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest, fair and candid. Deceit, dishonesty and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity. Service to the Company should never be subordinated to personal gain or advantage.

Each person must:



●
Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still maintaining the confidentiality of the Company’s information where required or when in its interests;




●
Observe all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;




●
Comply with the requirements of applicable accounting and auditing standards, as well as Company policies, in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy and completeness in the Company’s financial records and other business-related information and data;




●
Adhere to a high standard of business ethics and not seek competitive advantage through unlawful or unethical business practices;




●
Deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees;




●
Refrain from taking advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice;




●
Protect the assets of the Company and ensure their proper use;




●
Until the earliest of (i) the Company’s initial business combination (as such is defined in the Company’s initial registration statement filed with the SEC), (ii) liquidation, or (iii) such time as such person ceases to be an officer or director of the Company, to first present to the Company for its consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity, any business opportunity suitable for the Company, subject to the Company’s certificate of incorporation in effect from time to time and to any other fiduciary or contractual obligations such officer may have; and






●
Avoid conflicts of interest, wherever possible, except as may be allowed under guidelines or resolutions approved by the Board (or the appropriate committee of the Board) or as disclosed in the Company’s public filings with the SEC. Anything that would be a conflict for a person subject to this Code also will be a conflict for a member of his or her immediate family or any other close relative. Examples of conflict of interest situations include, but are not limited to, the following:




o
any significant ownership interest in any target, supplier or customer;




o
any consulting or employment relationship with any target, supplier or customer;




o
the receipt of any money, non-nominal gifts or excessive entertainment from any entity with which the Company has current or prospective business dealings;




o
selling anything to the Company or buying anything from the Company, except on the same terms and conditions as comparable officers or directors are permitted to so purchase or sell;




o
any other financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) involving the Company; and




o
any other circumstance, event, relationship or situation in which the personal interest of a person subject to this Code interferes — or even appears to interfere — with the interests of the Company as a whole.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit a director, officer, employee or contractor of the Company from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity or making other disclosures that are protected pursuant to federal law or regulation. Prior authorization from the Company is not required in order to make any such reports or disclosures and the reporting individual is not required to notify the Company that such reports or disclosures have been made.

In addition, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act, employees shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Should any provision in this Code conflict with this provision, this provision shall control.



3.
Disclosure


The Company strives to ensure that the contents of and the disclosures in the reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC and other public communications shall be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable in accordance with applicable disclosure standards, including standards of materiality, where appropriate. Each person must:



●
not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the Company, including to the Company’s independent registered public accountants, governmental regulators, self-regulating organizations and other governmental officials, as appropriate; and




●
in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyze proposed disclosure for accuracy and completeness.


In addition to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company (or persons performing similar functions), and each other person that typically is involved in the financial reporting of the Company must familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable to the Company as well as the business and financial operations of the Company.

Each person must promptly bring to the attention of the Chairman of the Board any information he or she may have concerning (a) significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal and/or disclosure controls that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data or (b) any fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s financial reporting, disclosures or internal controls.

2




4.
Compliance


It is the Company’s obligation and policy to comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. All directors, officers and employees of the Company are expected to understand, respect and comply with all of the laws, regulations, policies and procedures that apply to them in their positions with the Company. Employees are responsible for talking to their supervisors to determine which laws, regulations and Company policies apply to their position and what training is necessary to understand and comply with them.

Directors, officers and employees are directed to specific policies and procedures available to persons they supervise.



5.
Reporting and Accountability


The Board is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented to it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any person who becomes aware of any existing or potential breach of this Code is required to notify the Chairman of the Board promptly. Failure to do so is, in and of itself, a breach of this Code.

Specifically, each person must:



●
notify the Chairman of the Board promptly of any existing or potential violation of this Code; and




●
not retaliate against any other person for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith.




●
The Company will follow the following procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code and in reporting on this Code:




●
The Board will take all appropriate action to investigate any breaches reported to it.




●
Upon determination by the Board that a breach has occurred, the Board (by majority decision) will take or authorize such disciplinary or preventive action as it deems appropriate, after consultation with the Company’s internal or external legal counsel, up to and including dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious violations of law, notification of the SEC or other appropriate law enforcement authorities.


No person following the above procedure shall, as a result of following such procedure, be subject by the Company or any officer or employee thereof to discharge, demotion suspension, threat, harassment or, in any manner, discrimination against such person in terms and conditions of employment.



6.
Waivers and Amendments


Any waiver (defined below) or an implicit waiver (defined below) from a provision of this Code for the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions or any amendment (as defined below) to this Code is required to be disclosed in a current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. In lieu of filing a current report on Form 8-K to report any such waivers or amendments, the Company may provide such information on its website, in the event that it establishes one in the future, if it keeps such information on the website for at least 12 months and discloses the website address as well as any intention to provide such disclosures in this manner in its most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A “waiver” means the approval by the Board of a material departure from a provision of this Code. An “implicit waiver” means the Company’s failure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of this Code that has been made known to an executive officer of the Company. An “amendment” means any amendment to this Code other than minor technical, administrative or other non-substantive amendments hereto.

All persons should note that it is not the Company’s intention to grant or to permit waivers from the requirements of this Code. The Company expects full compliance with this Code.

7.
Insider Information and Securities Trading


No person who is aware of material, non-public information about the Company may, directly or indirectly, buy or sell the Company’s securities or engage in another action to take advantage of such information. It is also against the law to trade or to “tip” others who might make an investment decision based on material, non-public information about the Company. For example, using material, non-public information to buy or sell the Company’s securities, options in the Company’s securities or the securities of any Company supplier, customer or competitor is prohibited. The consequences of insider trading violations can be severe. These rules also apply to the use of material, nonpublic information about other companies (including, for example, our customers, competitors, potential business partners and potential targets). In addition to directors, officers or employees, these rules apply to such person’s spouse, children, parents and siblings, as well as any other family members living in such person’s home.



8.
Financial Statements and Other Records


All of the Company’s books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company’s transactions and must both conform to applicable legal requirements and to the Company’s system of internal controls. Unrecorded or “off the books” funds or assets should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation.

Records should always be retained or destroyed according to the Company’s record retention policies. In accordance with those policies, in the event of litigation or governmental investigation, please consult the Board or the Company’s internal or external legal counsel.



9.
Improper Influence on Conduct of Audits


No director or officer, or any other person acting under the direction thereof, shall directly or indirectly take any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence any public or certified public accountant engaged in the performance of an audit or review of the financial statements of the Company or take any action that such person knows or should know that if successful could result in rendering the Company’s financial statements materially misleading. Any person who believes such improper influence is being exerted should report such action to such person’s supervisor, or if that is impractical under the circumstances, to any of our directors.

Types of conduct that could constitute improper influence include, but are not limited to, directly or indirectly:



●
Offering or paying bribes or other financial incentives, including future employment or contracts for non-audit services;




●
Providing an auditor with an inaccurate or misleading legal analysis;




●
Threatening to cancel or canceling existing non-audit or audit engagements if the auditor objects to the Company’s accounting;




●
Seeking to have a partner removed from the audit engagement because the partner objects to the Company’s accounting;




●
Blackmailing; and




●
Making physical threats.




10.
Anti-Corruption Laws


The Company complies with the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which it does business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. To the extent prohibited by applicable law, directors, officers and employees will not directly or indirectly give anything of value to government officials, including employees of state-owned enterprises or foreign political candidates. These requirements apply both to Company employees and agents, such as third party sales representatives, no matter where they are doing business. If you are authorized to engage agents, you are responsible for ensuring they are reputable and for obtaining a written agreement to uphold the Company’s standards in this area.

11.
Violations


Violation of this Code is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Such action is in addition to any civil or criminal liability which might be imposed by any court or regulatory agency.



12.
Other Policies and Procedures


Any other policy or procedure set out by the Company in writing or made generally known to employees, officers or directors of the Company prior to the date hereof or hereafter are separate requirements and remain in full force and effect.



13.
Inquiries


All inquiries and questions in relation to this Code or its applicability to particular people or situations should be addressed to the Company’s Secretary, or such other compliance officer as shall be designated from time to time by the Company.

Each of the Company’s directors and executive officers shall inform the Chairman of the Committee of any potential Related Party Transactions. In addition, each such director and executive officer shall complete a questionnaire on an annual basis designed to elicit information about any potential Related Party Transactions.

Any potential Related Party Transactions that are brought to the Committee’s attention shall be analyzed by the Committee, in consultation with outside counsel or members of management, as appropriate, to determine whether the transaction or relationship does, in fact, constitute a Related Party Transaction requiring compliance with this Policy.

C. Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions.

At each of its meetings, the Committee shall be provided with the details of each new, existing or proposed Related Party Transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions that the Company has already committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits to the Company and to the relevant Related Party. In determining whether to approve a Related Party Transaction, the Committee shall consider, among other factors, the following factors to the extent relevant to the Related Party Transaction:



●
whether the terms of the Related Party Transaction are fair to the Company and on the same basis as would apply if the transaction did not involve a Related Party;




●
whether there are business reasons for the Company to enter into the Related Party Transaction;




●
whether the Related Party Transaction would impair the independence of an outside director;




●
whether the Related Party Transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer of the Company, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the director, executive officer or Related Party, the direct or indirect nature of the director’s, executive officer’s or Related Party’s interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship, and any other factors the Committee deems relevant; and




●
any pre-existing contractual obligations.


Any member of the Committee who has an interest in the transaction under discussion shall abstain from voting on the approval of the Related Party Transaction, but may, if so requested by the Chairman of the Committee, participate in some or all of the Committee’s discussions of the Related Party Transaction. Upon completion of its review of the transaction, the Committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the Related Party Transaction.

A Related Party Transaction entered into without pre-approval of the Committee shall not be deemed to violate this Policy, or be invalid or unenforceable, so long as the transaction is brought to the Committee as promptly as reasonably practical after it is entered into or after it becomes reasonably apparent that the transaction is covered by this Policy.

A Related Party Transaction entered into prior to the effective date of this Charter shall not be required to be reapproved by the Committee.

(q)          “Trust Property” shall mean as of any particular time any and all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which at such time is owned or held by or for the account of the Trust or the Trustees in such capacity.

(r)          “Trustees” shall mean all persons who at the time in question have been duly elected or appointed and have qualified as trustees in accordance with the provisions hereof and are then in office.

ARTICLE II
TRUSTEES

2.1         Number. The number of Trustees shall be determined by a vote of three-quarters (75%) of the Trustees then in office, provided that, after a public offering of Shares, the number of Trustees shall be no less than two (2) and no more than fifteen (15), and CNI RECF Advisors, LLC (the “Advisor”), for so long as it serves as the Trust’s investment advisor and as long as Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, shall appoint two (2) Trustees (each, an "Advisor Trustee"), subject to any shareholder vote required by the 1940 Act. No reduction in the number of Trustees shall have the effect of removing any Trustee from office prior to the expiration of his term. An individual nominated as a Trustee shall be at least 21 years of age and not older than 80 years of age at the time of nomination, unless otherwise determined by a vote of a majority of the Trustees then in office (excluding the Trustee at issue), and shall not be under legal disability. Trustees need not own Shares and may succeed themselves in office.

2.2         Term and Election. The term of office of a Trustee shall terminate and a vacancy shall 
occur in the event of the death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, adjudicated incompetence or other incapacity to perform the duties of the office of a Trustee. Subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Trustees at any time may appoint individuals to fill vacancies on the Board of Trustees. Each Trustee elected shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. The Trustees may set a mandatory retirement age for Trustees by a vote of at least two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the Trustees. 

- 3 -




2.3         Resignation and Removal. Any of the Trustees may resign their trust (without need for prior or subsequent accounting) by an instrument in writing signed by such Trustee and delivered or mailed to the Trustees or the Chairman (if any), the President, or the Secretary and such resignation shall be effective upon such delivery, or at a later date according to the terms of the instrument. Any of the Trustees may be removed (provided the aggregate number of Trustees after such removal shall not be less than the minimum number required by Section 2.1 hereof) (a) with or without cause at any meeting of Shareholders by a vote of 75% of the outstanding Shares; or (b) with or without cause at any time by a vote of all of the remaining Trustees, specifying the date when such removal shall become effective. Upon the resignation or removal of a Trustee, each such resigning or removed Trustee shall execute and deliver such documents as the remaining Trustees shall require for the purpose of conveying to the Trust or the remaining Trustees any Trust Property held in the name of such resigning or removed Trustee. Upon the incapacity or death of any Trustee, such Trustee’s legal representative shall execute and deliver on such Trustee’s behalf such documents as the remaining Trustees shall require as provided in the preceding sentence.

2.4         Vacancies. Whenever a vacancy in the Board of Trustees shall occur, the remaining Trustees may fill such vacancy by appointing an individual having the qualifications described in this Article by a written instrument signed by all of the Trustees then in office or may leave such vacancy unfilled or may reduce the number of Trustees; provided the aggregate number of Trustees after such reduction shall not be less than the minimum number required by Section 2.1 hereof; provided, further, that if the Shareholders of any class or series of Shares are entitled separately to elect one or more Trustees, a majority of the remaining Trustees then in office or the sole remaining Trustee elected by that class or series may fill any vacancy among the number of Trustees elected by that class or series; provided, further, that, for so long as the Advisor is serving as the Trust’s investment advisor and as long as Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, any vacancy created by the resignation, removal, incapacity or death of an Advisor Trustee may be filled only by a nominee selected by the Advisor. Any vacancy created by an increase in Trustees may be filled by the appointment of an individual having the qualifications described in this Article made by a written instrument signed by all of the Trustees then in office. The Trustees may appoint a new Trustee as provided above in anticipation of a vacancy expected to occur because of the retirement, resignation or removal of a Trustee, or an increase in the number of Trustees, provided that such appointment shall become effective only at or after the expected vacancy occurs. No vacancy shall operate to annul this Declaration or to revoke any existing agency created pursuant to the terms of this Declaration. Whenever a vacancy in the number of Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled as provided herein, the Trustees in office, regardless of their number, shall have all the powers granted to the Trustees and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon the Trustees by this Declaration.

2.5         Meetings. Meetings of the Trustees shall be held from time to time upon the call of the Chairman, if any, or the President, the Secretary or any two Trustees. Regular meetings of the Trustees may be held without call or notice at a time and place fixed by the Bylaws or by resolution of the Trustees. Notice of any other meeting shall be given by the Secretary and shall be delivered to the Trustees orally or via electronic transmission not less than 24 hours, or in writing not less than 72 hours, before the meeting, but may be waived in writing by any Trustee either before or after such meeting. The attendance of a Trustee at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except where a Trustee attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been properly called or convened. Any time there is more than one Trustee, a quorum for all meetings of the Trustees shall be a majority of the Trustees then in office, but not less than two of the Trustees. Unless provided otherwise in this Declaration and except as required under the 1940 Act, any action of the Trustees may be taken at a meeting by vote of a majority of the Trustees present (a quorum being present) or by written consent pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof.

Any committee of the Trustees, including an executive committee, if any, may act with or without a meeting. A quorum for all meetings of any such committee shall be a majority of the Trustees on such committee, but, if there is more than one Trustee on such committee, not less than two of the members thereof. Unless provided otherwise in this Declaration, any action of any such committee may be taken at a meeting by vote of a majority of the members present (a quorum being present) or without a meeting by written consent pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof.

With respect to actions of the Trustees and any committee of the Trustees, Trustees who are Interested Persons in any action to be taken may be counted for quorum purposes under this Section and shall be entitled to vote to the extent not prohibited by the 1940 Act.

All or any one or more Trustees may participate in a meeting of the Trustees or any committee thereof by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other; participation in a meeting pursuant to any such communications system shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

2.6         Trustee Action by Written Consent. Any action which may be taken by Trustees or a committee thereof by vote may be taken without a meeting if all of the Trustees or members of such committee consent to the action in writing and the written consents are filed with the records of the meetings of Trustees or such committee. Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of Trustees or such committee.

2.7         Officers.

(a)          The Trustees shall elect a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer and may elect such other officers or assistant officers as may be elected or authorized by the Trustees. Officers shall serve at the pleasure of the Trustees or until their successors are elected. The Trustees may elect or appoint or may authorize the Chairman, if any, or President to appoint such other officers or agents with such powers as the Trustees may deem to be advisable.


- 5 -




(b)          It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the officers of the Trust may manage or administer other investment funds and other accounts with similar or dissimilar mandates. Except as required by applicable law, an officer of the Trust shall not be obligated to offer any investment opportunity, or portion thereof, to the Trust. Each of the officers of the Trust and each of their respective affiliates and their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents may engage in, invest in, participate in or otherwise enter into other business ventures of any kind, nature and description, individually and with others, including, without limitation, the formation and management of other investment companies with or without the same or similar purposes as the Trust, and the ownership of and investment in assets, and neither the Trust nor any Shareholder shall have any right in or to any such activities or the income or profits derived therefrom. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each officer of the Trust and its respective affiliates may invest directly and indirectly with third parties from time to time in all manner of investments and transactions, some of which may be considered competitive with the Trust and which investments require time and effort of the staff of such officer and its affiliates. In connection therewith, in no event shall it be considered a violation of this Declaration or the Bylaws for an officer of the Trust or any of its affiliates or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to continue to engage in such investments and transactions nor shall the provisions of this Declaration or the Bylaws in any way limit or prohibit any future investments or transactions by an officer or any of its affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents directly or with third parties or in any way constrain the ability of an officer or any of its affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to manage and invest their assets. The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of any Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, replace such other duties and liabilities of such Person.

2.8         Chairman. The Trustees may designate a Chairman and a Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees, who shall not, in their capacity as Chairman and Vice Chairman, be considered officers of the Trust but shall have such powers and duties as determined by the Board of Trustees from time to time.

2.9         Trustee as Expert. The appointment, designation or identification of a Trustee as Chairman or Vice Chairman, a member or chair of a committee of the Trustees, an expert on any topic or in any area (including an audit committee financial expert), or the lead independent Trustee, or any other special appointment, designation or identification of a Trustee, shall not impose on that person any standard of care or liability that is greater than that imposed on that person as a Trustee in the absence of the appointment, designation or identification, and no Trustee who has special skills or expertise, or is appointed, designated or identified as aforesaid, shall be held to a higher standard of care by virtue thereof. In addition, no appointment, designation or identification of a Trustee as aforesaid shall affect in any way that Trustee’s rights or entitlement to indemnification or advancement of expenses.

ARTICLE III
POWERS AND DUTIES OF TRUSTEES

3.1         General. The Trustees shall manage or direct the management of the Trust Property and the business of the Trust with such powers of delegation as may be permitted by this Declaration. The Trustees shall owe to the Trust and its Shareholders the same fiduciary duties (and only such fiduciary duties) as owed by directors of corporations to such corporations and their stockholders under the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, such fiduciary duties shall not be deemed to control to the extent that the express terms of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration or the Bylaws conflict with or are inconsistent with such fiduciary duties in which case the express terms of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration or the Bylaws shall control. The Trustees shall have exclusive and absolute control over the Trust Property and over the business of the Trust to the same extent as if the Trustees were the sole owners of the Trust Property and business in their own right, but with such powers of delegation as may be permitted by this Declaration. The Trustees may perform such acts as in their sole discretion are proper for conducting the business of the Trust. The enumeration of any specific power herein shall not be construed as limiting the aforesaid power. Such powers of the Trustees may be exercised without order of or resort to any court. It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Trustees of the Trust may manage, administer, or serve as trustee to other investment funds and other accounts with similar or dissimilar mandates. Except as required by applicable law, a Trustee of the Trust shall not be obligated to offer any investment opportunity, or portion thereof, to the Trust. Each of the Trustees of the Trust and each of their respective affiliates and their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents may engage in, invest in, participate in or otherwise enter into other business ventures of any kind, nature and description, individually and with others, including, without limitation, the formation and management of other investment companies with or without the same or similar purposes as the Trust, and the ownership of and investment in assets, and neither the Trust nor any Shareholder shall have any right in or to any such activities or the income or profits derived therefrom. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each Trustee of the Trust and his or her respective affiliates may invest directly and indirectly with third parties from time to time in all manner of investments and transactions, some of which may be considered competitive with the Trust and which investments require time and effort of such Trustee and his or her affiliates. In connection therewith, in no event shall it be considered a violation of this Declaration or the Bylaws for a Trustee of the Trust or any of his or her affiliates or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to continue to engage in such investments and transactions nor shall the provisions of this Declaration or the Bylaws in any way limit or prohibit any future investments or transactions by a Trustee or any of his or her affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents directly or with third parties or in any way constrain the ability of a Trustee or any of his or her affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to manage and invest their assets. The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of any Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, replace such other duties and liabilities of such Person.

3.2         Investments. The Trustees shall have power, subject to the Fundamental Policies in effect from time to time with respect to the Trust, to:

(a)          manage, conduct, operate and carry on the business of an investment company; and


- 7 -




(b)          subscribe for, invest in, reinvest in, purchase or otherwise acquire, hold, pledge, sell, assign, transfer, exchange, distribute or otherwise deal in or dispose of any and all sorts of property, tangible or intangible, including but not limited to securities of any type whatsoever (including investing substantially all of the assets of the Trust in CC Real Estate Income Master Fund (the "Master Fund")), whether equity or non-equity, of any issuer, evidences of indebtedness of any Person and any other rights, interests, instruments or property of any sort and to exercise any and all rights, powers and privileges of ownership or interest in respect of any and all such investments of every kind and description, including, without limitation, the right to consent and otherwise act with respect thereto, with power to designate one or more Persons to exercise any of said rights, powers and privileges in respect of any of said investments. The Trustees shall not be limited by any law limiting the investments which may be made by fiduciaries.

3.3         Legal Title. Legal title to all the Trust Property shall be vested in the Trust except that the Trustees shall have power to cause legal title to any Trust Property to be held by or in the name of one or more of the Trustees, or in the name of any other Person as nominee, custodian or pledgee, on such terms as the Trustees may determine, provided that the interest of the Trust therein is appropriately protected.

To the extent any Trust Property is titled in the name of one or more Trustees, the right, title and interest of the Trustees in the Trust Property shall vest automatically in each person who may hereafter become a Trustee upon his due election and qualification. Upon the ceasing of any person to be a Trustee for any reason, such person shall automatically cease to have any right, title or interest in any of the Trust Property, and the right, title and interest of such Trustee in the Trust Property shall vest automatically in the remaining Trustees. Such vesting and cessation of title shall be effective whether or not conveyancing documents have been executed and delivered.

3.4         Issuance and Repurchase of Shares. The Trustees shall have the power to issue, sell, repurchase, redeem, retire, cancel, acquire, hold, resell, reissue, dispose of, transfer, and otherwise deal in, Shares, including Shares in fractional denominations, and, subject to the more detailed provisions set forth in Articles VIII and IX, to apply to any such repurchase, redemption, retirement, cancellation or acquisition of Shares any funds or property whether capital or surplus or otherwise.

3.5         Borrow Money or Utilize Leverage. Subject to the Fundamental Policies in effect from time to time with respect to the Trust, the Trustees shall have the power to borrow money or otherwise obtain credit or utilize leverage to the maximum extent permitted by law or regulation as such may be needed from time to time and to secure the same by mortgaging, pledging or otherwise subjecting as security the assets of the Trust, including the lending of portfolio securities, and to endorse, guarantee, or undertake the performance of any obligation, contract or engagement of any other Person, firm, association or corporation.

3.6         Delegation; Committees. The Trustees shall have the power, consistent with their continuing exclusive authority over the management of the Trust and the Trust Property, to delegate from time to time to such of their number or to officers, employees or agents of the Trust the doing of such things, including any matters set forth in this Declaration, and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of the Trustees or otherwise as the Trustees may deem expedient. The Trustees may designate one or more committees which shall have all or such lesser portion of the authority of the entire Board of Trustees as the Trustees shall determine from time to time except to the extent action by the entire Board of Trustees or particular Trustees is required by the 1940 Act.


- 8 -




3.7         Collection and Payment. The Trustees shall have power to collect all property due to the Trust; to pay all claims, including taxes, against the Trust Property or the Trust, the Trustees or any officer, employee or agent of the Trust; to prosecute, defend, compromise or abandon any claims relating to the Trust Property or the Trust, or the Trustees or any officer, employee or agent of the Trust; to foreclose any security interest securing any obligations, by virtue of which any property is owed to the Trust; and to enter into releases, agreements and other instruments.

3.8         Expenses. The Trustees shall have power to incur and pay out of the assets or income of the Trust any expenses which in the opinion of the Trustees are necessary or incidental to carry out any of the purposes of this Declaration, and the business of the Trust, and to pay reasonable compensation from the funds of the Trust to themselves as Trustees. The Trustees shall fix the compensation of all officers, employees and Trustees. The Trustees may pay themselves such compensation for special services, including legal, underwriting, syndicating and brokerage services, as they in good faith may deem reasonable and reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred by themselves on behalf of the Trust. The Trustees shall have the power, as frequently as they may determine, to cause each Shareholder to pay directly, in advance or arrears, for charges of distribution, of the custodian or transfer, Shareholder servicing or similar agent, a pro rata amount as defined from time to time by the Trustees, by setting off such charges due from such Shareholder from declared but unpaid dividends or distributions owed such Shareholder and/or by reducing the number of shares in the account of such Shareholder by that number of full and/or fractional Shares which represents the outstanding amount of such charges due from such Shareholder.

3.9         Bylaws. The Trustees shall have the exclusive authority to adopt and from time to time amend or repeal Bylaws for the conduct of the business of the Trust.

3.10       Miscellaneous Powers. The Trustees shall have the power to: (a) employ or contract with such Persons as the Trustees may deem desirable for the transaction of the business of the Trust; (b) enter into joint ventures, partnerships and any other combinations or associations; (c) purchase, and pay for out of Trust Property, insurance policies insuring the Shareholders, Trustees, officers, employees, agents, investment advisors, distributors, selected dealers or independent contractors of the Trust against all claims arising by reason of holding any such position or by reason of any action taken or omitted by any such Person in such capacity, whether or not constituting negligence, or whether or not the Trust would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability; (d) establish pension, profit-sharing, share purchase, and other retirement, incentive and benefit plans for any Trustees, officers, employees and agents of the Trust; (e) make donations, irrespective of benefit to the Trust, for charitable, religious, educational, scientific, civic or similar purposes; (f) to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 5.2, indemnify any Person with whom the Trust has dealings, including without limitation any advisor, administrator, manager, transfer agent, custodian, distributor or selected dealer, or any other Person as the Trustees may see fit to such extent as the Trustees shall determine; (g) subject to Section 3.5, guarantee indebtedness or contractual obligations of others; (h) determine and change the fiscal year of the Trust and the method in which its accounts shall be kept; and (i) adopt a seal for the Trust, even though the absence of such seal shall not impair the validity of any instrument executed on behalf of the Trust.


- 9 -




3.11       Further Powers. The Trustees shall have the power to conduct the business of the Trust and carry on its operations in any and all of its branches and maintain offices both within and without the State of Delaware, in any and all states of the United States of America, in the District of Columbia, and in any and all commonwealths, territories, dependencies, colonies, possessions, agencies or instrumentalities of the United States of America and of foreign governments, and to do all such other things and execute all such instruments as they deem necessary, proper or desirable in order to promote the interests of the Trust although such things are not herein specifically mentioned. In construing the provisions of this Declaration, the presumption shall be in favor of a grant of power to the Trustees. The Trustees will not be required to obtain any court order to deal with the Trust Property. The Trustees have the power to construe and interpret this Declaration and to act upon any such construction and interpretation. Any construction or interpretation of this Declaration by the Trustees and any action taken pursuant thereto and any determination as to what is in the interest of the Trust and the Shareholders made by the Trustees in good faith shall, in each case, be conclusive and binding on all Shareholders and all other Persons for all purposes.

ARTICLE IV
ADVISORY, MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS

4.1         Advisory and Management Arrangements. Subject to the requirements of applicable law as in effect from time to time, the Trustees may in their discretion from time to time enter into advisory, administration or management contracts (including, in each case, one or more sub-advisory, sub-administration or sub-management contracts) whereby the other party to any such contract shall undertake to furnish such advisory, administrative and management services with respect to the Trust as the Trustees shall from time to time consider desirable and all upon such terms and conditions as the Trustees may in their discretion determine. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Declaration, the Trustees may authorize any advisor, administrator or manager (subject to such general or specific instructions as the Trustees may from time to time adopt) to exercise any of the powers of the Trustees, including to effect investment transactions with respect to the assets on behalf of the Trust to the full extent of the power of the Trustees to effect such transactions or may authorize any officer, employee or Trustee to effect such transactions pursuant to recommendations of any such advisor, administrator or manager (and all without further action by the Trustees). Any such investment transaction shall be deemed to have been authorized by all of the Trustees.

4.2         Distribution Arrangements. Subject to compliance with the 1940 Act, the Trustees may retain underwriters and/or selling agents to sell Shares and other securities of the Trust. The Trustees may in their discretion from time to time enter into one or more contracts, providing for the sale of securities of the Trust, whereby the Trust may either agree to sell such securities to the other party to the contract or appoint such other party its sales agent for such securities. In either case, the contract shall be on such terms and conditions as the Trustees may in their discretion determine not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article IV or the Bylaws; and such contract may also provide for the repurchase or sale of securities of the Trust by such other party as principal or as agent of the Trust and may provide that such other party may enter into selected dealer agreements with registered securities dealers and brokers and servicing and similar agreements with Persons who are not registered securities dealers to further the purposes of the distribution or repurchase of the securities of the Trust.

TRUSTEES

2.1         Number. The number of Trustees shall be determined by a vote of three-quarters (75%) of the Trustees then in office, provided that, after a public offering of Shares, the number of Trustees shall be no less than two (2) and no more than fifteen (15), and CNI RECF Advisors, LLC (the “Advisor”), for so long as it serves as the Trust’s investment advisor and as long as Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, shall appoint two (2) Trustees (each, an "Advisor Trustee"), subject to any shareholder vote required by the 1940 Act. No reduction in the number of Trustees shall have the effect of removing any Trustee from office prior to the expiration of his term. An individual nominated as a Trustee shall be at least 21 years of age and not older than 80 years of age at the time of nomination, unless otherwise determined by a vote of a majority of the Trustees then in office (excluding the Trustee at issue), and shall not be under legal disability. Trustees need not own Shares and may succeed themselves in office.

2.2         Term and Election. The term of office of a Trustee shall terminate and a vacancy shall occur in the event of the death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, adjudicated incompetence or other incapacity to perform the duties of the office of a Trustee. Subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Trustees at any time may appoint individuals to fill vacancies on the Board of Trustees. Each Trustee elected shall hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. The Trustees may set a mandatory retirement age for Trustees by a vote of at least two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the Trustees.

2.3         Resignation and Removal. Any of the Trustees may resign their trust (without need for prior or subsequent accounting) by an instrument in writing signed by such Trustee and delivered or mailed to the Trustees or the Chairman (if any), the President, or the Secretary and such resignation shall be effective upon such delivery, or at a later date according to the terms of the instrument. Any of the Trustees may be removed (provided the aggregate number of Trustees after such removal shall not be less than the minimum number required by Section 2.1 hereof) (a) with or without cause at any meeting of Shareholders by a vote of 75% of the outstanding Shares; or (b) with or without cause at any time by a vote of all of the remaining Trustees, specifying the date when such removal shall become effective. Upon the resignation or removal of a Trustee, each such resigning or removed Trustee shall execute and deliver such documents as the remaining Trustees shall require for the purpose of conveying to the Trust or the remaining Trustees any Trust Property held in the name of such resigning or removed Trustee. Upon the incapacity or death of any Trustee, such Trustee’s legal representative shall execute and deliver on such Trustee’s behalf such documents as the remaining Trustees shall require as provided in the preceding sentence.

2.4         Vacancies. Whenever a vacancy in the Board of Trustees shall occur, the remaining Trustees may fill such vacancy by appointing an individual having the qualifications described in this Article by a written instrument signed by all of the Trustees then in office or may leave such vacancy unfilled or may reduce the number of Trustees; provided the aggregate number of Trustees after such reduction shall not be less than the minimum number required by Section 2.1 hereof; provided, further, that if the Shareholders of any class or series of Shares are entitled separately to elect one or more Trustees, a majority of the remaining Trustees then in office or the sole remaining Trustee elected by that class or series may fill any vacancy among the number of Trustees elected by that class or series; provided, further, that, for so long as the Advisor is serving as the Trust’s investment advisor and as long as Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, any vacancy created by the resignation, removal, incapacity or death of an Advisor Trustee may be filled only by a nominee selected by the Advisor. Any vacancy created by an increase in Trustees may be filled by the appointment of an individual having the qualifications described in this Article made by a written instrument signed by all of the Trustees then in office. The Trustees may appoint a new Trustee as provided above in anticipation of a vacancy expected to occur because of the retirement, resignation or removal of a Trustee, or an increase in the number of Trustees, provided that such appointment shall become effective only at or after the expected vacancy occurs. No vacancy shall operate to annul this Declaration or to revoke any existing agency created pursuant to the terms of this Declaration. Whenever a vacancy in the number of Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled as provided herein, the Trustees in office, regardless of their number, shall have all the powers granted to the Trustees and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon the Trustees by this Declaration.

2.5         Meetings. Meetings of the Trustees shall be held from time to time upon the call of the Chairman, if any, or the President, the Secretary or any two Trustees. Regular meetings of the Trustees may be held without call or notice at a time and place fixed by the Bylaws or by resolution of the Trustees. Notice of any other meeting shall be given by the Secretary and shall be delivered to the Trustees orally or via electronic transmission not less than 24 hours, or in writing not less than 72 hours, before the meeting, but may be waived in writing by any Trustee either before or after such meeting. The attendance of a Trustee at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except where a Trustee attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been properly called or convened. Any time there is more than one Trustee, a quorum for all meetings of the Trustees shall be a majority of the Trustees then in office, but not less than two of the Trustees. Unless provided otherwise in this Declaration and except as required under the 1940 Act, any action of the Trustees may be taken at a meeting by vote of a majority of the Trustees present (a quorum being present) or by written consent pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof.

Any committee of the Trustees, including an executive committee, if any, may act with or without a meeting. A quorum for all meetings of any such committee shall be a majority of the Trustees on such committee, but, if there is more than one Trustee on such committee, not less than two of the members thereof. Unless provided otherwise in this Declaration, any action of any such committee may be taken at a meeting by vote of a majority of the members present (a quorum being present) or without a meeting by written consent pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof.

With respect to actions of the Trustees and any committee of the Trustees, Trustees who are Interested Persons in any action to be taken may be counted for quorum purposes under this Section and shall be entitled to vote to the extent not prohibited by the 1940 Act.

All or any one or more Trustees may participate in a meeting of the Trustees or any committee thereof by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other; participation in a meeting pursuant to any such communications system shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

2.6         Trustee Action by Written Consent. Any action which may be taken by Trustees or a committee thereof by vote may be taken without a meeting if all of the Trustees or members of such committee consent to the action in writing and the written consents are filed with the records of the meetings of Trustees or such committee. Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of Trustees or such committee.

2.7         Officers.

(a)          The Trustees shall elect a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer and may elect such other officers or assistant officers as may be elected or authorized by the Trustees. Officers shall serve at the pleasure of the Trustees or until their successors are elected. The Trustees may elect or appoint or may authorize the Chairman, if any, or President to appoint such other officers or agents with such powers as the Trustees may deem to be advisable.


- 5 -




(b)          It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the officers of the Trust may manage or administer other investment funds and other accounts with similar or dissimilar mandates. Except as required by applicable law, an officer of the Trust shall not be obligated to offer any investment opportunity, or portion thereof, to the Trust. Each of the officers of the Trust and each of their respective affiliates and their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents may engage in, invest in, participate in or otherwise enter into other business ventures of any kind, nature and description, individually and with others, including, without limitation, the formation and management of other investment companies with or without the same or similar purposes as the Trust, and the ownership of and investment in assets, and neither the Trust nor any Shareholder shall have any right in or to any such activities or the income or profits derived therefrom. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each officer of the Trust and its respective affiliates may invest directly and indirectly with third parties from time to time in all manner of investments and transactions, some of which may be considered competitive with the Trust and which investments require time and effort of the staff of such officer and its affiliates. In connection therewith, in no event shall it be considered a violation of this Declaration or the Bylaws for an officer of the Trust or any of its affiliates or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to continue to engage in such investments and transactions nor shall the provisions of this Declaration or the Bylaws in any way limit or prohibit any future investments or transactions by an officer or any of its affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents directly or with third parties or in any way constrain the ability of an officer or any of its affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to manage and invest their assets. The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of any Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, replace such other duties and liabilities of such Person.

2.8         Chairman. The Trustees may designate a Chairman and a Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees, who shall not, in their capacity as Chairman and Vice Chairman, be considered officers of the Trust but shall have such powers and duties as determined by the Board of Trustees from time to time.

2.9         Trustee as Expert. The appointment, designation or identification of a Trustee as Chairman or Vice Chairman, a member or chair of a committee of the Trustees, an expert on any topic or in any area (including an audit committee financial expert), or the lead independent Trustee, or any other special appointment, designation or identification of a Trustee, shall not impose on that person any standard of care or liability that is greater than that imposed on that person as a Trustee in the absence of the appointment, designation or identification, and no Trustee who has special skills or expertise, or is appointed, designated or identified as aforesaid, shall be held to a higher standard of care by virtue thereof. In addition, no appointment, designation or identification of a Trustee as aforesaid shall affect in any way that Trustee’s rights or entitlement to indemnification or advancement of expenses.

ARTICLE III
POWERS AND DUTIES OF TRUSTEES

3.1         General. The Trustees shall manage or direct the management of the Trust Property and the business of the Trust with such powers of delegation as may be permitted by this Declaration. The Trustees shall owe to the Trust and its Shareholders the same fiduciary duties (and only such fiduciary duties) as owed by directors of corporations to such corporations and their stockholders under the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, such fiduciary duties shall not be deemed to control to the extent that the express terms of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration or the Bylaws conflict with or are inconsistent with such fiduciary duties in which case the express terms of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration or the Bylaws shall control. The Trustees shall have exclusive and absolute control over the Trust Property and over the business of the Trust to the same extent as if the Trustees were the sole owners of the Trust Property and business in their own right, but with such powers of delegation as may be permitted by this Declaration. The Trustees may perform such acts as in their sole discretion are proper for conducting the business of the Trust. The enumeration of any specific power herein shall not be construed as limiting the aforesaid power. Such powers of the Trustees may be exercised without order of or resort to any court. It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Trustees of the Trust may manage, administer, or serve as trustee to other investment funds and other accounts with similar or dissimilar mandates. Except as required by applicable law, a Trustee of the Trust shall not be obligated to offer any investment opportunity, or portion thereof, to the Trust. Each of the Trustees of the Trust and each of their respective affiliates and their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents may engage in, invest in, participate in or otherwise enter into other business ventures of any kind, nature and description, individually and with others, including, without limitation, the formation and management of other investment companies with or without the same or similar purposes as the Trust, and the ownership of and investment in assets, and neither the Trust nor any Shareholder shall have any right in or to any such activities or the income or profits derived therefrom. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each Trustee of the Trust and his or her respective affiliates may invest directly and indirectly with third parties from time to time in all manner of investments and transactions, some of which may be considered competitive with the Trust and which investments require time and effort of such Trustee and his or her affiliates. In connection therewith, in no event shall it be considered a violation of this Declaration or the Bylaws for a Trustee of the Trust or any of his or her affiliates or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to continue to engage in such investments and transactions nor shall the provisions of this Declaration or the Bylaws in any way limit or prohibit any future investments or transactions by a Trustee or any of his or her affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents directly or with third parties or in any way constrain the ability of a Trustee or any of his or her affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to manage and invest their assets. The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of any Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, replace such other duties and liabilities of such Person.

3.2         Investments. The Trustees shall have power, subject to the Fundamental Policies in effect from time to time with respect to the Trust, to:

(a)          manage, conduct, operate and carry on the business of an investment company; and

(b)          subscribe for, invest in, reinvest in, purchase or otherwise acquire, hold, pledge, sell, assign, transfer, exchange, distribute or otherwise deal in or dispose of any and all sorts of property, tangible or intangible, including but not limited to securities of any type whatsoever (including investing substantially all of the assets of the Trust in CC Real Estate Income Master Fund (the "Master Fund")), whether equity or non-equity, of any issuer, evidences of indebtedness of any Person and any other rights, interests, instruments or property of any sort and to exercise any and all rights, powers and privileges of ownership or interest in respect of any and all such investments of every kind and description, including, without limitation, the right to consent and otherwise act with respect thereto, with power to designate one or more Persons to exercise any of said rights, powers and privileges in respect of any of said investments. The Trustees shall not be limited by any law limiting the investments which may be made by fiduciaries.

3.3         Legal Title. Legal title to all the Trust Property shall be vested in the Trust except that the Trustees shall have power to cause legal title to any Trust Property to be held by or in the name of one or more of the Trustees, or in the name of any other Person as nominee, custodian or pledgee, on such terms as the Trustees may determine, provided that the interest of the Trust therein is appropriately protected.

To the extent any Trust Property is titled in the name of one or more Trustees, the right, title and interest of the Trustees in the Trust Property shall vest automatically in each person who may hereafter become a Trustee upon his due election and qualification. Upon the ceasing of any person to be a Trustee for any reason, such person shall automatically cease to have any right, title or interest in any of the Trust Property, and the right, title and interest of such Trustee in the Trust Property shall vest automatically in the remaining Trustees. Such vesting and cessation of title shall be effective whether or not conveyancing documents have been executed and delivered.

3.4         Issuance and Repurchase of Shares. The Trustees shall have the power to issue, sell, repurchase, redeem, retire, cancel, acquire, hold, resell, reissue, dispose of, transfer, and otherwise deal in, Shares, including Shares in fractional denominations, and, subject to the more detailed provisions set forth in Articles VIII and IX, to apply to any such repurchase, redemption, retirement, cancellation or acquisition of Shares any funds or property whether capital or surplus or otherwise.

3.5         Borrow Money or Utilize Leverage. Subject to the Fundamental Policies in effect from time to time with respect to the Trust, the Trustees shall have the power to borrow money or otherwise obtain credit or utilize leverage to the maximum extent permitted by law or regulation as such may be needed from time to time and to secure the same by mortgaging, pledging or otherwise subjecting as security the assets of the Trust, including the lending of portfolio securities, and to endorse, guarantee, or undertake the performance of any obligation, contract or engagement of any other Person, firm, association or corporation.

3.6         Delegation; Committees. The Trustees shall have the power, consistent with their continuing exclusive authority over the management of the Trust and the Trust Property, to delegate from time to time to such of their number or to officers, employees or agents of the Trust the doing of such things, including any matters set forth in this Declaration, and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of the Trustees or otherwise as the Trustees may deem expedient. The Trustees may designate one or more committees which shall have all or such lesser portion of the authority of the entire Board of Trustees as the Trustees shall determine from time to time except to the extent action by the entire Board of Trustees or particular Trustees is required by the 1940 Act.


- 8 -




3.7         Collection and Payment. The Trustees shall have power to collect all property due to the Trust; to pay all claims, including taxes, against the Trust Property or the Trust, the Trustees or any officer, employee or agent of the Trust; to prosecute, defend, compromise or abandon any claims relating to the Trust Property or the Trust, or the Trustees or any officer, employee or agent of the Trust; to foreclose any security interest securing any obligations, by virtue of which any property is owed to the Trust; and to enter into releases, agreements and other instruments.

3.8         Expenses. The Trustees shall have power to incur and pay out of the assets or income of the Trust any expenses which in the opinion of the Trustees are necessary or incidental to carry out any of the purposes of this Declaration, and the business of the Trust, and to pay reasonable compensation from the funds of the Trust to themselves as Trustees. The Trustees shall fix the compensation of all officers, employees and Trustees. The Trustees may pay themselves such compensation for special services, including legal, underwriting, syndicating and brokerage services, as they in good faith may deem reasonable and reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred by themselves on behalf of the Trust. The Trustees shall have the power, as frequently as they may determine, to cause each Shareholder to pay directly, in advance or arrears, for charges of distribution, of the custodian or transfer, Shareholder servicing or similar agent, a pro rata amount as defined from time to time by the Trustees, by setting off such charges due from such Shareholder from declared but unpaid dividends or distributions owed such Shareholder and/or by reducing the number of shares in the account of such Shareholder by that number of full and/or fractional Shares which represents the outstanding amount of such charges due from such Shareholder.

3.9         Bylaws. The Trustees shall have the exclusive authority to adopt and from time to time amend or repeal Bylaws for the conduct of the business of the Trust.

3.10       Miscellaneous Powers.

The Trustees shall have the power to conduct the business of the Trust and carry on its operations in any and all of its branches and maintain offices both within and without the State of Delaware, in any and all states of the United States of America, in the District of Columbia, and in any and all commonwealths, territories, dependencies, colonies, possessions, agencies or instrumentalities of the United States of America and of foreign governments, and to do all such other things and execute all such instruments as they deem necessary, proper or desirable in order to promote the interests of the Trust although such things are not herein specifically mentioned. In construing the provisions of this Declaration, the presumption shall be in favor of a grant of power to the Trustees. The Trustees will not be required to obtain any court order to deal with the Trust Property.

Convertible Debt [Abstract]

CONVERTIBLE DEBT
In March and May 2017, we closed a private placement transaction in which we issued to certain accredited investors unregistered senior callable convertible promissory notes, or the Notes, and three-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 125,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.52 per share in exchange for aggregate gross proceeds of $6,000,000. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4% per annum. $5,300,000 in principal was originally scheduled to mature on August 31, 2018 and $700,000 in principal was originally scheduled to mature on November 8, 2018, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. The Notes are convertible at the option of the holder into common stock at a conversion price of $4.32 per share. Subsequent to September 1, 2017, we may redeem the Notes that are scheduled to mature on August 31, 2018 at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date.  Prior to November 8, 2018, we may redeem the Notes that are scheduled to mature on such date at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in cash on February 28 and August 31 of each year, beginning on August 31, 2017.  Interest expense related to the Notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $0 and $40,689, respectively. Interest expense related to the Notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $50,000 and $150,000, respectively.

The warrants were valued at $62,559 using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility: 104.06% –111.54%; expected dividend: $0; expected term: 3 years; and risk-free rate: 1.49%–1.59%. We recorded the warrants’ relative fair value of $61,904 as an increase to additional paid-in capital and a discount against the related Notes.

The debt discount was amortized over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. Amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $0 and $17,534, respectively.

In February and March 2018, we extended the maturity date of the Notes— we extended the maturity date to April 1, 2019 for $5,300,000 of principal on the Notes and to June 8, 2019 for the remaining $700,000 Note. No additional consideration was paid or accrued by us. The stated rate of the Notes was unchanged, and the estimated fair value of the new debt approximates its carrying amount (principal plus accrued interest at the date of the modification). We determined that the modification of these Notes is not a substantial modification in accordance with ASC 470-50, “Modifications and Extinguishments”.

In May 2018, we offered a noteholder the option to convert its Note at a reduced conversion price of $3.68. The noteholder accepted and converted at such price. Pursuant to the terms of the conversion offer, an aggregate of $700,000 of principal and $5,212 of accrued interest outstanding under the Note were converted into 234,745 shares of common stock.  We recognized an induced conversion cost of $57,201 related to the conversion.

In December 2018, a noteholder redeemed a note with a principal balance of $300,000 in exchange for $150,000 in cash. We recognized a gain on redemption of convertible note income in the amount of $150,000 as a result of the transaction.

On March 30, 2019, the two remaining noteholders agreed to extend the maturity dates of their notes totaling $5,000,000 to April 3, 2020. As part of the extensions, we agreed that if we do not make payment on or before the new maturity dates, after five (5) days written notice, the holders will have the right, but not the obligation, to convert the notes into our common shares at a conversion price of $0.88 per share or a total of 5,681,818 shares. All other provisions of the notes remain unchanged. We determined that the modification of these Notes is not a substantial modification in accordance with ASC 470-50, “Modifications and Extinguishments”.

In March 2020, convertible notes with a principal balance of $4,500,000 were converted into 1,041,667 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $4.32 per share and the remaining outstanding balance of $500,000 was repaid in the form of cash. With respect to the 125,000 warrants issued as part of the convertible note transaction, 100,000 warrants expired in March 2020. In March 2020, 10,417, warrants were exercised, and 14,583 warrants expired in May 2020.

Additional Information
The content of this summary, and the available detailed report, is governed by FINRA Rule 8312, and is primarily based on information filed on uniform registration forms. Rule 8312, amendments to the rule and notices related to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval orders, can be viewed here.

State regulators are governed by their public records laws (not FINRA Rule 8312), and may provide information not in BrokerCheck, including information no longer required to be reported or updated on uniform registration forms due, for example, to its age or final disposition. You may contact your state regulator to request this additional information.

B	Broker
A brokerage firm, also called a broker-dealer, is in the business of buying and selling securities – stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and certain other investment products – on behalf of its customer (as broker), for its own bank (dealer), or both.
Individuals who work for broker-dealers – the sales personnel are commonly referred to as brokers.
IA	Investment Adviser
An investment adviser is paid for providing advice about securities to clients. In addition, some investment advisers manage investment portfolios and offer financial planning services.
It is common for a financial professional to act as both a broker and an investment adviser. Because of this, we include investment advisers on BrokerCheck, and provide links to the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website so you can research further.
PR	Previously Registered
A Previously Registered broker or brokerage firm is not currently licensed to act as a broker (buying and selling securities on behalf of customers) or as an investment adviser (providing advice about securities to clients). They may still be able to offer other investment-related services if properly licensed to do so. Click here to learn more.

The market-based net asset value per share of the Share Class is calculated using current market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) to value its price per share to four decimal places ("Market-Based NAV"). The Fund does not currently transact using its Market-Based NAV.Pursuant to Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund uses the amortized cost method of accounting to value its securities when calculating its net asset value, rounded to two decimals, for purpose of all fund share transactions (the "Transaction NAV"). Amortized cost is the book price of a security (the price a fund pays for a security) as adjusted over time to reflect any discount or premium. The Market-Based NAV can deviate from $1.0000, even if financial markets are largely stable. If a fund's Market-Based NAV rises above $1.0050 or falls below $0.9950, the fund's board must promptly consider what action if any, should be taken. Although the Market-Based NAV seeks to reflect the price at which a fund's securities could be sold, the actual sales price could be more or less.The Share Class' Market-Based NAV is shown as of the final time that the net asset value was calculated for the Share Class on that business day and is shown as of the end of each business day for the Share Class during the preceding six months.The performance quoted is past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data shown.

Under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a taxable money market fund (MMF) may not acquire any security other than a "daily liquid asset" unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 10% of its total assets would be invested in daily liquid assets and no money market fund may acquire any security other than a "weekly liquid asset" unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 30% of its total assets would be invested in weekly liquid assets. "Daily liquid assets" include: (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business day; and (iv) amounts receivable and due unconditionally within one business day pending sales of portfolio securities. "Weekly liquid assets" include: (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity without the provision for the payment of interest and mature within 60 days; (iv) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business days; and (v) amounts receivable and due unconditionally within five business days on pending sales of portfolio securities.Under the amendments to Rule 2a-7, if a Money Market Fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets, the MMF's board, in its discretion, may impose liquidity fees of up to 2% of the value of the shares redeemed and/or gates on redemptions. In addition, if a MMF's weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets at the end of any business day, the Fund must impose a 1% liquidity fee on shareholder redemptions unless the MMF's Board of Trustees determines that not doing so is in the best interests of the MMF. The compliance date for these amendments is October 14, 2016.The Fund's daily liquid asset and weekly liquid asset figures are shown as of the final time that the net asset value was calculated for the Fund on that business day and are shown as of the end of each business day during the preceding six months.For further information please call 1-800-766-7722 (institutional investors) or 1-800-480-4111 (retail investors).

title: Heroku Deployment
layout: en
deploy: v1


Travis CI can automatically deploy your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) application after a successful build.

To use the default configuration, add your encrypted Heroku api key to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key:
    secure: "YOUR ENCRYPTED API KEY"
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

If you have both the [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and [Travis CI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#readme) command line clients installed, you can get your key, encrypt it and add it to your `.travis.yml` by running the following command from your project directory:

```bash
travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key
```

`travis` command defaults to using [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org) as the API endpoint. If your build runs on [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com) (even if your repository is public), add `--pro` flag to override this:

```bash
travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key --pro
```
You can also use the Travis CI command line setup tool `travis setup heroku`.

## Deploying Custom Application Names

By default, we will try to deploy to an application by the same name as the repository. For example, if you deploy an application from the GitHub repository [travis-ci/travis-chat](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-chat) without explicitly specify the name of the application, Travis CI will try to deploy to a Heroku app named *travis-chat*.

You can explicitly set the name via the **app** option:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  app: my-app-123
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

It is also possible to deploy different branches to different applications:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  app:
    master: my-app-staging
    production: my-app-production
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

If these apps belong to different Heroku accounts, you will have to do the same for the API key:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key:
    master: ...
    production: ...
  app:
    master: my-app-staging
    production: my-app-production
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

## Deploying Specific Branches

If you have branch specific options, as [shown above](#deploying-custom-application-names), Travis CI will automatically figure out which branches to deploy from. Otherwise, it will only deploy from your **master** branch.

You can also explicitly specify the branch to deploy from with the **on** option:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  on: production
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

Alternatively, you can also configure it to deploy from all branches:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  on:
    all_branches: true
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

Builds triggered from Pull Requests will never trigger a deploy.

## Running Commands

In some setups, you might want to run a command on Heroku after a successful deploy. You can do this with the **run** option:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  run: "rake db:migrate"
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

It also accepts a list of commands:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  run:
    - "rake db:migrate"
    - "rake cleanup"
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

> Take note that Heroku app might not be completely deployed and ready to serve requests when we run your commands. To mitigate this situation, you can add a `sleep` statement to add a delay before your commands.

### Error Logs for Custom Commands

Custom Heroku commands do not affect the Travis CI build status or trigger Travis CI notifications.

Use an addon such as [Papertrail](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/papertrail){: data-proofer-ignore=""} or [Logentries](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/logentries){: data-proofer-ignore=""} to get notifications for `rake db:migrate` or other commands.

These add-ons have email notification systems that can be triggered when certain string matches occur in your Heroku logs. For example you could trigger an e-mail notification if the log contains "this and all later migrations canceled".

### Restarting Applications

Sometimes you want to restart your Heroku application between or after commands. You can easily do so by adding a "restart" command:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  run:
    - "rake db:migrate"
    - restart
    - "rake cleanup"
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

## Deploying build artifacts

After your tests ran and before the deploy, Travis CI will clean up any additional files and changes you made.

Maybe that is not what you want, as you might generate some artifacts (think asset compilation) that are supposed to be deployed, too. There is now an option to skip the clean up:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  skip_cleanup: true
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

{% include conditional_deploy.html provider="heroku" %}

### Deploy Strategy

Travis CI supports different mechanisms for deploying to Heroku:

- **api:** Uses Heroku's [Build API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-and-release-using-the-api). This is the default strategy.
- **git:** Does a `git push` over HTTPS.

It defaults to **api**, but you can change that via the **strategy** option:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key: ...
  strategy: git
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

#### Using `.gitignore` on `git` strategy

When you use any of the `git` strategies, be mindful that the deployment will
honor `.gitignore`.

If your `.gitignore` file matches something that your build creates, use
[`before_deploy`](#running-commands-before-and-after-deploy) to change
its content.
