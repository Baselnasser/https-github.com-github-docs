Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.

 

  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.

From https://github.com/owner/repo * [new ref] refs/pull/8896/head -> patch-2 M README.md Switched to branch 'patch-2' ~/Projects/my-project$

  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.

 

NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.

 

In anticipating for your urgent cooperation

 

Thank you, God Bless America.
