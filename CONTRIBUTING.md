How do I purchase savings bonds in TreasuryDirect?
NOTE:  All Savings Bonds are issued in electronic form; no paper bonds are issued.

You may purchase savings bonds by using the Payroll Savings Plan or BuyDirect®.

The Payroll Savings Plan:

The Payroll Savings Plan feature allows individual primary account-holders to make recurring purchases of electronic Series EE and Series I Savings Bonds, funded by a payroll allotment/direct deposit from their employer.

Note: You must first set up a Payroll Savings Plan in your TreasuryDirect account. After you set up your plan, start your payroll allotment/direct deposit with your employer.

Here's how to set up your Payroll Savings Plan:

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Click the Establish My Payroll Savings Plan link on the ManageDirect page.
On the Establish My Payroll Savings Plan page, your preferred TreasuryDirect registration is displayed. To use a different registration for your savings bond, choose one from the drop-down box, or add another by clicking "Add New Registration". (If a gift registration, remember to click the "This is a gift" box at the bottom of the Add New Registration page.) Once you've created the desired registration, you'll be brought back to the Payroll Savings Plan page you were originally on with the registration(s) added to the drop-down box.
Choose the registration you want.
Select the Product Type you want to buy from the drop-down box. Choose either Series EE or Series I.
Enter the purchase amount. The purchase amount of a savings bond can be any amount from $25 to $10,000. (Note: This is not your allotment/direct deposit amount; your allotment/direct deposit amount is the amount you authorize your employer to withhold from each pay.)
Review the Terms and Conditions information.
Click "Submit".
Next you'll see the My Payroll Savings Plan Confirmation page.
Contact your payroll office to complete the necessary authorization for a payroll allotment/direct deposit. To begin receiving these credits, give your payroll office the following information for scheduling electronic direct deposits into your TreasuryDirect account:
TreasuryDirect's Routing Number 051736158;
Your ten-digit TreasuryDirect account number, without hyphens, followed by the letter 'P' (Example: A123456789P);
The amount of your allotment/direct deposit; and
Your TreasuryDirect account can be marked as a type 22 (checking) or 32 (savings). We will accept either type.
The incoming credits from your payroll office will result in the purchase of a Payroll Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness (Payroll C of I) within your TreasuryDirect account. Each time your Payroll C of I balance reaches your designated Purchase Amount, a savings bond will be issued.

Making changes to an established Payroll Savings Plan. If you have already established your Payroll Savings Plan and wish to edit your registration, product type, or purchase amount, click the "Edit My Payroll Savings Plan link" on the ManageDirect page.


BuyDirect:

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the BuyDirect tab at the top of the page.
On the BuyDirect page, choose the series of Savings Bonds and click "Submit".
Under the heading Registration Information, choose the desired registration from the drop-down box. (If the registration you want is not listed, you can create it by clicking "Add New Registration". If a gift registration, remember to click the "This is a gift" box at the bottom of the Add New Registration page. Once you've created the desired registration, you'll be brought back to the BuyDirect page where you can choose the registration you just created from the drop-down box.) Note: Entity accounts may only have one registration. All securities in an entity account carry a registration identical to the entity account name.
Under the heading Purchase Information, enter the Purchase Amount (from $25.00 to $10,000.00). Note: Electronic savings bonds are always purchased at full face value. For example, you pay $50 for a $50 savings bond.
Select a source of funds you wish to debit from the drop-down box. You may choose to use your bank account or your Zero-Percent C of I. If you scheduled regular deductions with your employer to purchase a Zero-Percent C of I within your account, be sure to select "Zero-Percent C of I" as the source of funds. Note: If you established a Payroll Savings Plan in TreasuryDirect, see the section above, titled "The Payroll Savings Plan".
Under the heading Purchase Frequency, the system will default to Schedule single purchase for today's date.
If you wish to change it to a future date, simply enter the date you want.
If you'd rather set up repeat purchases, choose the button for Schedule repeat purchases and choose the frequency from the drop-down box. You can then enter the beginning and ending dates for the purchase schedule.
If you want to select your own dates, choose the button for Schedule purchases by selecting your own dates and enter each date in the spaces provided. If you want to schedule more than six dates, click "Schedule More".  Click "Submit" to proceed.
The Purchase Review page will then appear. Please review the information and read the statements at the bottom. (If you wish to change any of the data you entered, click the "Edit" button to go back to the previous page where you can make any desired changes.) If the data on the Purchase Review page is accurate including the purchase date, click "Submit".
You'll then see a Confirmation Page listing the details of the purchase, including the Purchase Date and Confirmation Number for each security.

Savings bond purchases are generally issued to your TreasuryDirect account within one business day of the purchase date. If you select a non-business day as your purchase date, we will change it to the next available business day.

How do I open an account for a minor?
A Minor account is a custodial account you may establish for a child under the age of 18 if you are a parent or person providing chief support of the child. You may purchase, redeem, receive gifts, and perform other transactions within an individual account on behalf of the minor. You can even create a customized name, such as "Ben's College Fund", for the account. When the minor reaches age 18 and establishes a Primary TreasuryDirect account, you may de-link the securities from the Minor account to move them to the new Primary account.

How do I convert my paper savings bonds into electronic savings bonds?
Before you can convert your paper savings bonds, you must first create a Conversion Linked Account:

In your primary account, click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Under the heading Manage My Linked Accounts, click "Establish a Conversion Linked Account".
The Establish a Conversion Account page will appear.
Click the "Create Account" button. You will be directed to your new Conversion Linked account and you can begin the conversion process from the ManageDirect page.
Note: In the future, you must access your Conversion Linked account through your Primary account.
The name for the Conversion account 'My Converted Bonds', followed by its TreasuryDirect account number, appears in the top right corner of the Account Info page. The two arrows let you know that you're currently viewing the Conversion account. To go back to your primary account, click the link above the conversion account number.

Step 1 - Getting Started

Gather your Series EE and I Savings Bonds; please don't sign the back of your savings bonds.
Sort savings bonds by the name(s) on them:
One name alone,
two names with OR,
one name with POD (or beneficiary) to a second name,
any others.
Note: In an entity account, all securities will carry a registration identical to your Entity Account name.
Log in to your TreasuryDirect account at a computer with access to a printer.
Access your conversion linked account (My Converted Bonds).
Click on the ManageDirect tab.
Step 2 - Adding Registrations to Your Conversion Linked Account (individual accounts only ‐ does not apply to entity accounts)

Bonds registered in co-owner form (two names with the connective OR) will be restricted once the bonds are converted. A "Restricted Security" is a converted Series EE or Series I savings bond on which a co-owner (connective OR) is named.

Because the converted savings bonds were originally issued in paper form, the rights of the registrants are still protected by the regulations under which they were issued. For instance, a co-owner cannot be removed from the registration of a Series EE or Series I savings bond during the co-owner's lifetime without his or her consent. TreasuryDirect ® does not permit the account owner to change the registration of converted securities if they are restricted.

The restriction will remain on the bonds until the co-owner who did not request the conversion consents to a change in registration. When the consent is received from the co-owner, a customer service representative can change the registration.

The restriction does not affect your ability to cash the bonds.

Minors

If you wish to convert bonds on which your minor child is named as a co-owner with you--the Primary Account owner--and you wish to deliver the bonds to a Minor Linked Account in the name of the minor, provide this information in the Comments field when you enter the Security Information on the Add a Bond page. Once the bonds are converted, they will appear in your child's Minor Linked Account.

If you do not provide the instructions before the bonds are converted, transferring the bonds from your account to an account with a different taxpayer identification account number--such as your child's Minor Linked account--is reported to the IRS for the tax year in which the transfer occurs. The Minor Linked Account must be established before converted bonds may be delivered to the account. If you wish to create an account for your minor child, select Establish a Minor Linked Account under Manage My Linked Accounts on the ManageDirect page in your Primary Account.

Deceased registrant

If anyone listed on the bonds is deceased, omit their name from the registration. You will need to submit a certified copy of the death certificate. Other evidence might be required also. The bonds will be converted in the surviving registrant's name alone. (We don't return death certificates or other legal evidence.)

Procedure to add registrations

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click on the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Under Manage My Conversions, click on "Create my registration list". For each different registration, enter the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and name of each registrant. If a registrant's TIN is not known, enter zeros: 000-00-0000.
Note: For your convenience, a registration with your name and TIN is already in the registration list as a Single Owner registration type.
For a registration Type:
Select 'Single Owner' if one person is named.
Select the connector that appears: 'OR' or 'Payable on Death' (may be shown as POD or Beneficiary) for two names.
Select 'OTHER' if a different connector appears, such as AND or WITH. Note: If the bond is not registered in an authorized form, we will change the registration to the closest authorized form. In other circumstances, we may contact you after we receive the bonds and provide appropriate instructions to complete the transaction.
Click "Submit & Add Another" to add more registrations until you have entered all the different registrations you have. When you have entered your last different registration, click "Submit".
Step 3 - Adding the Bonds to Your Conversion Linked Account

Click the ManageDirect tab to go back to Manage My Conversions and click "Convert my bonds."
Select the registration for the bond you are adding to the Conversion Cart, and click "Select Registration & Continue."
On Add a Bond page:
Select the Series and Denomination that appear on the bond. If you need to choose another registration, click "Select a Different Registration."
Enter the Serial Number and Issue Date (month and year).
Enter any additional information in the Comments field, such as
Your name has been changed, or
You wish to convert bonds on which your minor child is named as a co-owner with you, and you wish to deliver the bonds to the Minor Linked Account in the name of the minor.
Click "Add to Cart." Your cart is automatically saved every time you add a bond. If you can't finish, click "Save Cart", and log off. When you would like to return to add more bonds, go to ManageDirect and click either "Convert my bonds" or "View my cart".
Note: Your cart will notify you if you are submitting a bond that is fully matured. When you convert a bond that has reached final maturity, TreasuryDirect will automatically cash (redeem) it and purchase a Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness (C of I) in your Primary account. The interest earned is reported to the IRS for the tax year of the redemption. If you need to remove a bond from the cart, select the checkbox under the Remove column and click "Remove Checked Items". To correct information on a bond that's in your cart, you must remove it and re-enter.

You can only add bonds to one cart at a time and each cart is limited to 50 bonds at a time. After you click "Create a Manifest", the cart is emptied and you can add more bonds, if necessary. A new manifest is created with each cart of bonds you submit. Since each manifest is individually numbered, you can create as many manifests as you need in order to exchange all your paper bonds. Important! Once you click "Create a Manifest", you cannot return to that cart to add more bonds.

Step 4 - Creating a Manifest From Your Cart to Mail With Your Bonds

On the Conversion Cart page, click "Create a Manifest" to continue with the conversion request. A numbered manifest lists the bonds that you put in the cart. (If you have saved a cart in a previous session, you access your cart from the View My Cart option in ManageDirect.)
Print and sign the manifest. Keep a copy of the manifest.
Mail the manifest with your bonds to the address shown on the form. Please don't sign the back of your savings bonds.
After You Submit Your Bonds

You will not receive a notification when we receive the bonds or when the conversion process is complete. However, you may check the status of your bonds at any time, through your TreasuryDirect Conversion linked account. Click ManageDirect, then "View my manifests". Select the manifest you wish to view and click the "Submit" button. You will see one of the following notations in the Status column next to the bonds on your manifest:

In Progress- processing in progress;
Pending - Customer Service needs additional information;
Returned - Bond returned to you as ineligible for conversion;
Not received - Treasury did not receive the bond listed on the manifest;
Canceled - Bond closed in previous transaction. For example, a replacement bond was issued after being reported lost, stolen, or destroyed; or
Converted - Bond converted. Check your Current Holdings or Gift Box in My Converted Bonds Linked Account, or your Minor Linked Account.

How do I add a secondary owner or beneficiary to my securities?
Adding a secondary owner or beneficiary to securities registered in single ownership form is simple in TreasuryDirect. You can edit securities being held in Current Holdings; however, you cannot edit savings bonds held in your Gift Box. Securities in a Conversion Linked account (CLA) must first be transferred to a primary or another linked account in order to add a secondary owner.

Your electronic savings bonds and marketable securities may be registered in your name alone, your name with a secondary owner, or your name with a beneficiary. Each registrant's taxpayer identification number must be shown.  Note:  Registrations in entity accounts may not name a secondary owner or beneficiary.  All securities in an entity account carry a registration identical to the entity account name. Updates made to the registration of a bond will not change the issue date.

To add a secondary owner or beneficiary to your securities registered in single ownership form:

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Under the heading Manage My Securities click "Edit" a registration.
On the Edit Security Registration page, choose the security type you want to edit and click "Select".
On the Summary page, choose the security or securities you wish to edit and click "Select" (you may edit up to 50 securities to the same registration).
On the Detail page, select the registration containing the secondary owner or beneficiary you desire from the drop-down box. (If you've never created the registration, you can do so by clicking "Add New Registration". Once you've created the new registration, the system will bring you back to the Detail page where you'll find the new registration listed in the drop-down box.) Note: Entity accounts may only have one registration. All securities in an entity account carry a registration identical to the entity account name.
Once you've selected the desired registration, click "Submit" to complete the change in registration for the security.

How do I grant View and Transact Rights to securities held in my TreasuryDirect account?
You may grant View rights only to a security held in your name to any individual TreasuryDirect account holder. View/Transact rights may be granted to the second-named registrant of a security with Primary Owner registration. View rights may only be granted to the Beneficiary of a security with that registration. Transact rights allow the second-named registrant, or grantee, to transfer a security, as well as change the maturity and/or interest payment destination. Note: View/Transact rights are not available in entity accounts.

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Select Assign View or Transact rights from the Manage My Securities box.
On the Assign Rights page, choose the type of security you wish to assign rights for, and click "Select".
On the Assign Rights Summary page, choose the security you wish to assign rights to, and click "Select".
On the Assign Rights Detail page, click the "Add" button at the bottom of the page.
On the Add Rights page,
Enter the grantee's account number in the Grantee's TreasuryDirect Account # field.
Choose rights you wish to grant (The page will default to View rights only. If you wish to grant Transact rights, choose the appropriate radio button).
Click "Submit".
The Assign Rights Summary page will be displayed with a message describing the type of rights granted and the name of the grantee. The message will also advise an e-mail has been sent to the grantee explaining the rights you granted.

Note: View and Transact Rights may also be edited or deleted by clicking the "Edit" or "Delete" button at the bottom of the Assign Rights Detail page.

How do I redeem a security for which I have transact rights?
Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Under the heading Manage My Shared Securities, click "Redeem a security".
The Redemption page lists securities in alphabetical order by the last name of the grantor who has given you transact rights. Select the button beside the confirmation number of the security you wish to cash, and click "Submit".
On the Redemption Request page, either leave the default button selected for Redeem full amount or select the button for Redeem partial amount and enter the desired amount (Note: In a partial redemption, you must redeem at least $25 and leave a value of $25 for the security.)
If you have more than one bank account listed, select the account you would like to credit with the proceeds from the drop-down box.
Click "Submit" on the Redemption Request page.
The Redemption Review page will then be displayed.
If any information needs to be changed, click "Edit" and make the changes.
Otherwise, click "Submit".
A Redemption Confirmation page will be displayed to verify completion of the request. You may wish to print a copy of this page for your records.

How do I receive my tax statement?
An electronic tax statement is created in lieu of a paper statement and is available inside your TreasuryDirect account by the end of January. It's only available when you have reportable interest for the tax year in question. The account application includes the agreement to accept the tax statement electronically instead of on paper.

Here's how to retrieve your tax statement:

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click on the ManageDirect tab.
Under the heading Manage My Taxes, select the tax year.
On the Taxable Transactions Summary screen you can view your taxable transactions.
If the tax statement is available for the selected tax year, a link to view your 1099 will appear at the top of the page.
Click on the link to view your tax statement.
If you have established Custom Accounts, Minor Linked Accounts or a Conversion Linked Account, you must access each account individually using the Manage My Linked Accounts box to retrieve statements for those accounts.

Note: Transfers to another account with the same taxpayer identification number are not displayed because these are not reportable transactions.

How do I purchase savings bonds in TreasuryDirect?
NOTE:  All Savings Bonds are issued in electronic form; no paper bonds are issued.

You may purchase savings bonds by using the Payroll Savings Plan or BuyDirect®.

The Payroll Savings Plan:

The Payroll Savings Plan feature allows individual primary account-holders to make recurring purchases of electronic Series EE and Series I Savings Bonds, funded by a payroll allotment/direct deposit from their employer.

Note: You must first set up a Payroll Savings Plan in your TreasuryDirect account. After you set up your plan, start your payroll allotment/direct deposit with your employer.

Here's how to set up your Payroll Savings Plan:

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Click the Establish My Payroll Savings Plan link on the ManageDirect page.
On the Establish My Payroll Savings Plan page, your preferred TreasuryDirect registration is displayed. To use a different registration for your savings bond, choose one from the drop-down box, or add another by clicking "Add New Registration". (If a gift registration, remember to click the "This is a gift" box at the bottom of the Add New Registration page.) Once you've created the desired registration, you'll be brought back to the Payroll Savings Plan page you were originally on with the registration(s) added to the drop-down box.
Choose the registration you want.
Select the Product Type you want to buy from the drop-down box. Choose either Series EE or Series I.
Enter the purchase amount. The purchase amount of a savings bond can be any amount from $25 to $10,000. (Note: This is not your allotment/direct deposit amount; your allotment/direct deposit amount is the amount you authorize your employer to withhold from each pay.)
Review the Terms and Conditions information.
Click "Submit".
Next you'll see the My Payroll Savings Plan Confirmation page.
Contact your payroll office to complete the necessary authorization for a payroll allotment/direct deposit. To begin receiving these credits, give your payroll office the following information for scheduling electronic direct deposits into your TreasuryDirect account:
TreasuryDirect's Routing Number 051736158;
Your ten-digit TreasuryDirect account number, without hyphens, followed by the letter 'P' (Example: A123456789P);
The amount of your allotment/direct deposit; and
Your TreasuryDirect account can be marked as a type 22 (checking) or 32 (savings). We will accept either type.
The incoming credits from your payroll office will result in the purchase of a Payroll Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness (Payroll C of I) within your TreasuryDirect account. Each time your Payroll C of I balance reaches your designated Purchase Amount, a savings bond will be issued.

Making changes to an established Payroll Savings Plan. If you have already established your Payroll Savings Plan and wish to edit your registration, product type, or purchase amount, click the "Edit My Payroll Savings Plan link" on the ManageDirect page.


BuyDirect:

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the BuyDirect tab at the top of the page.
On the BuyDirect page, choose the series of Savings Bonds and click "Submit".
Under the heading Registration Information, choose the desired registration from the drop-down box. (If the registration you want is not listed, you can create it by clicking "Add New Registration". If a gift registration, remember to click the "This is a gift" box at the bottom of the Add New Registration page. Once you've created the desired registration, you'll be brought back to the BuyDirect page where you can choose the registration you just created from the drop-down box.) Note: Entity accounts may only have one registration. All securities in an entity account carry a registration identical to the entity account name.
Under the heading Purchase Information, enter the Purchase Amount (from $25.00 to $10,000.00). Note: Electronic savings bonds are always purchased at full face value. For example, you pay $50 for a $50 savings bond.
Select a source of funds you wish to debit from the drop-down box. You may choose to use your bank account or your Zero-Percent C of I. If you scheduled regular deductions with your employer to purchase a Zero-Percent C of I within your account, be sure to select "Zero-Percent C of I" as the source of funds. Note: If you established a Payroll Savings Plan in TreasuryDirect, see the section above, titled "The Payroll Savings Plan".
Under the heading Purchase Frequency, the system will default to Schedule single purchase for today's date.
If you wish to change it to a future date, simply enter the date you want.
If you'd rather set up repeat purchases, choose the button for Schedule repeat purchases and choose the frequency from the drop-down box. You can then enter the beginning and ending dates for the purchase schedule.
If you want to select your own dates, choose the button for Schedule purchases by selecting your own dates and enter each date in the spaces provided. If you want to schedule more than six dates, click "Schedule More".  Click "Submit" to proceed.
The Purchase Review page will then appear. Please review the information and read the statements at the bottom. (If you wish to change any of the data you entered, click the "Edit" button to go back to the previous page where you can make any desired changes.) If the data on the Purchase Review page is accurate including the purchase date, click "Submit".
You'll then see a Confirmation Page listing the details of the purchase, including the Purchase Date and Confirmation Number for each security.

Savings bond purchases are generally issued to your TreasuryDirect account within one business day of the purchase date. If you select a non-business day as your purchase date, we will change it to the next available business day.

How do I redeem savings bonds being held in my TreasuryDirect account?
Note: United States Savings Bonds must be held for a minimum of one year from their issue date before they are eligible to be redeemed.

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the ManageDirect® tab at the top of the page.
Under the heading Manage My Securities, click "Redeem securities".
On the Redemption page, choose the button beside the security type you want to redeem and click "Submit".
On the Summary page, check the box beside each security that you want to redeem and click "Select". You may select up to 50 securities per redemption transaction.
The process from here differs depending on whether you have selected one or more than one security for redemption:
If more than one security was selected for redemption, you will see the Multiple Redemption Request page. If redeeming more than one security, the full amount must be redeemed to the same financial institution.
If only one security was selected for redemption, you will see the Redemption Request page. On this page, either leave the default button selected for Redeem full amount or select the button for Redeem partial amount and enter the desired amount. (Note: In a partial redemption, you must redeem at least $25 and leave a value of $25 in the security.)
From the drop-down box, select the destination (bank account or C of I) you would like to credit with the proceeds.
Click "Review" on the Redemption Request or the Multiple Redemption Request page.
The Redemption Review or Multiple Redemption Review page is then displayed. If any information needs to be changed, click "Edit" and make the changes. Otherwise, click "Submit".
A Redemption Confirmation or Multiple Redemption Confirmation page will be displayed to signify completion of the request. You may wish to print a copy of this page for your records.

How do I cancel pending purchases and reinvestments in my TreasuryDirect account?
Pending purchases and reinvestments include securities that have not been issued to the investor's current holdings or gift box. Since pending purchases cannot be edited, they must be deleted, and new purchases scheduled. There are restrictions, however. Marketable securities, for example, can only be deleted prior to the close of the auction. Savings bonds and Zero-Percent Certificates of Indebtedness can be deleted up to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, the day before issue. Instructions are provided below concerning how to delete pending purchases.

If this particular pending purchase is part of a repeat savings bond purchase schedule, you'll then see another page where you will be asked if you want to delete just this purchase or all of the remaining purchases for this repeat purchase schedule. Make sure the appropriate button is selected and click "Select".
The planned purchase transactions are now deleted.

How do I convert my paper savings bonds into electronic savings bonds?
Before you can convert your paper savings bonds, you must first create a Conversion Linked Account:

In your primary account, click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Under the heading Manage My Linked Accounts, click "Establish a Conversion Linked Account".
The Establish a Conversion Account page will appear.
Click the "Create Account" button. You will be directed to your new Conversion Linked account and you can begin the conversion process from the ManageDirect page.
Note: In the future, you must access your Conversion Linked account through your Primary account.
The name for the Conversion account 'My Converted Bonds', followed by its TreasuryDirect account number, appears in the top right corner of the Account Info page. The two arrows let you know that you're currently viewing the Conversion account. To go back to your primary account, click the link above the conversion account number.

Step 1 - Getting Started

Gather your Series EE and I Savings Bonds; please don't sign the back of your savings bonds.
Sort savings bonds by the name(s) on them:
One name alone,
two names with OR,
one name with POD (or beneficiary) to a second name,
any others.
Note: In an entity account, all securities will carry a registration identical to your Entity Account name.
Log in to your TreasuryDirect account at a computer with access to a printer.
Access your conversion linked account (My Converted Bonds).
Click on the ManageDirect tab.
Step 2 - Adding Registrations to Your Conversion Linked Account (individual accounts only ‐ does not apply to entity accounts)

Bonds registered in co-owner form (two names with the connective OR) will be restricted once the bonds are converted. A "Restricted Security" is a converted Series EE or Series I savings bond on which a co-owner (connective OR) is named.

Because the converted savings bonds were originally issued in paper form, the rights of the registrants are still protected by the regulations under which they were issued. For instance, a co-owner cannot be removed from the registration of a Series EE or Series I savings bond during the co-owner's lifetime without his or her consent. TreasuryDirect ® does not permit the account owner to change the registration of converted securities if they are restricted.

The restriction will remain on the bonds until the co-owner who did not request the conversion consents to a change in registration. When the consent is received from the co-owner, a customer service representative can change the registration.

The restriction does not affect your ability to cash the bonds.

Minors

If you wish to convert bonds on which your minor child is named as a co-owner with you--the Primary Account owner--and you wish to deliver the bonds to a Minor Linked Account in the name of the minor, provide this information in the Comments field when you enter the Security Information on the Add a Bond page. Once the bonds are converted, they will appear in your child's Minor Linked Account.

If you do not provide the instructions before the bonds are converted, transferring the bonds from your account to an account with a different taxpayer identification account number--such as your child's Minor Linked account--is reported to the IRS for the tax year in which the transfer occurs. The Minor Linked Account must be established before converted bonds may be delivered to the account. If you wish to create an account for your minor child, select Establish a Minor Linked Account under Manage My Linked Accounts on the ManageDirect page in your Primary Account.

Deceased registrant

If anyone listed on the bonds is deceased, omit their name from the registration. You will need to submit a certified copy of the death certificate. Other evidence might be required also. The bonds will be converted in the surviving registrant's name alone. (We don't return death certificates or other legal evidence.)

Procedure to add registrations

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click on the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Under Manage My Conversions, click on "Create my registration list". For each different registration, enter the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and name of each registrant. If a registrant's TIN is not known, enter zeros: 000-00-0000.
Note: For your convenience, a registration with your name and TIN is already in the registration list as a Single Owner registration type.
For a registration Type:
Select 'Single Owner' if one person is named.
Select the connector that appears: 'OR' or 'Payable on Death' (may be shown as POD or Beneficiary) for two names.
Select 'OTHER' if a different connector appears, such as AND or WITH. Note: If the bond is not registered in an authorized form, we will change the registration to the closest authorized form. In other circumstances, we may contact you after we receive the bonds and provide appropriate instructions to complete the transaction.
Click "Submit & Add Another" to add more registrations until you have entered all the different registrations you have. When you have entered your last different registration, click "Submit".
Step 3 - Adding the Bonds to Your Conversion Linked Account

Click the ManageDirect tab to go back to Manage My Conversions and click "Convert my bonds."
Select the registration for the bond you are adding to the Conversion Cart, and click "Select Registration & Continue."
On Add a Bond page:
Select the Series and Denomination that appear on the bond. If you need to choose another registration, click "Select a Different Registration."
Enter the Serial Number and Issue Date (month and year).
Enter any additional information in the Comments field, such as
Your name has been changed, or
You wish to convert bonds on which your minor child is named as a co-owner with you, and you wish to deliver the bonds to the Minor Linked Account in the name of the minor.
Click "Add to Cart." Your cart is automatically saved every time you add a bond. If you can't finish, click "Save Cart", and log off. When you would like to return to add more bonds, go to ManageDirect and click either "Convert my bonds" or "View my cart".
Note: Your cart will notify you if you are submitting a bond that is fully matured. When you convert a bond that has reached final maturity, TreasuryDirect will automatically cash (redeem) it and purchase a Zero-Percent Certificate of Indebtedness (C of I) in your Primary account. The interest earned is reported to the IRS for the tax year of the redemption. If you need to remove a bond from the cart, select the checkbox under the Remove column and click "Remove Checked Items". To correct information on a bond that's in your cart, you must remove it and re-enter.

You can only add bonds to one cart at a time and each cart is limited to 50 bonds at a time. After you click "Create a Manifest", the cart is emptied and you can add more bonds, if necessary. A new manifest is created with each cart of bonds you submit. Since each manifest is individually numbered, you can create as many manifests as you need in order to exchange all your paper bonds. Important! Once you click "Create a Manifest", you cannot return to that cart to add more bonds.

Step 4 - Creating a Manifest From Your Cart to Mail With Your Bonds

On the Conversion Cart page, click "Create a Manifest" to continue with the conversion request. A numbered manifest lists the bonds that you put in the cart. (If you have saved a cart in a previous session, you access your cart from the View My Cart option in ManageDirect.)
Print and sign the manifest. Keep a copy of the manifest.
Mail the manifest with your bonds to the address shown on the form. Please don't sign the back of your savings bonds.
After You Submit Your Bonds

You will not receive a notification when we receive the bonds or when the conversion process is complete. However, you may check the status of your bonds at any time, through your TreasuryDirect Conversion linked account. Click ManageDirect, then "View my manifests". Select the manifest you wish to view and click the "Submit" button. You will see one of the following notations in the Status column next to the bonds on your manifest:

In Progress- processing in progress;
Pending - Customer Service needs additional information;
Returned - Bond returned to you as ineligible for conversion;
Not received - Treasury did not receive the bond listed on the manifest;
Canceled - Bond closed in previous transaction. For example, a replacement bond was issued after being reported lost, stolen, or destroyed; or
Converted - Bond converted. Check your Current Holdings or Gift Box in My Converted Bonds Linked Account, or your Minor Linked Account.

How do I add a secondary owner or beneficiary to my securities?
Adding a secondary owner or beneficiary to securities registered in single ownership form is simple in TreasuryDirect. You can edit securities being held in Current Holdings; however, you cannot edit savings bonds held in your Gift Box. Securities in a Conversion Linked account (CLA) must first be transferred to a primary or another linked account in order to add a secondary owner.

Your electronic savings bonds and marketable securities may be registered in your name alone, your name with a secondary owner, or your name with a beneficiary. Each registrant's taxpayer identification number must be shown.  Note:  Registrations in entity accounts may not name a secondary owner or beneficiary.  All securities in an entity account carry a registration identical to the entity account name. Updates made to the registration of a bond will not change the issue date.

To add a secondary owner or beneficiary to your securities registered in single ownership form:

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Under the heading Manage My Securities click "Edit" a registration.
On the Edit Security Registration page, choose the security type you want to edit and click "Select".
On the Summary page, choose the security or securities you wish to edit and click "Select" (you may edit up to 50 securities to the same registration).
On the Detail page, select the registration containing the secondary owner or beneficiary you desire from the drop-down box. (If you've never created the registration, you can do so by clicking "Add New Registration". Once you've created the new registration, the system will bring you back to the Detail page where you'll find the new registration listed in the drop-down box.) Note: Entity accounts may only have one registration. All securities in an entity account carry a registration identical to the entity account name.
Once you've selected the desired registration, click "Submit" to complete the change in registration for the security.

How do I grant View and Transact Rights to securities held in my TreasuryDirect account?
You may grant View rights only to a security held in your name to any individual TreasuryDirect account holder. View/Transact rights may be granted to the second-named registrant of a security with Primary Owner registration. View rights may only be granted to the Beneficiary of a security with that registration. Transact rights allow the second-named registrant, or grantee, to transfer a security, as well as change the maturity and/or interest payment destination. Note: View/Transact rights are not available in entity accounts.

Log into your primary TreasuryDirect ® account.
Click the ManageDirect tab at the top of the page.
Select Assign View or Transact rights from the Manage My Securities box.
On the Assign Rights page, choose the type of security you wish to assign rights for, and click "Select".
On the Assign Rights Summary page, choose the security you wish to assign rights to, and click "Select".

On the Add Rights page,
Enter the grantee's account number in the Grantee's TreasuryDirect Account # field.
Choose rights you wish to grant (The page will default to View rights only. If you wish to grant Transact rights, choose the appropriate radio button).
Click "Submit".
The Assign Rights Summary page will be displayed with a message describing the type of rights granted and the name of the grantee. The message will also advise an e-mail has been sent to the grantee explaining the rights you granted.

Note: View and Transact Rights may also be edited or deleted by clicking the "Edit" or "Delete" button at the bottom of the Assign Rights Detail page.

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix based systems use `\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could possibly cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows
