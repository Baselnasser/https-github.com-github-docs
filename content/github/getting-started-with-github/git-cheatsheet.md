Learning all available Git commands at once can be a daunting task. You can use the "[Git Cheat Sheets](https://training.github.com/)" for a quick reference to frequently used commands. The "Using Git" cheat sheet is available in several languages. 

In addition, take a look at our [Git and GitHub learning resources](/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/) page that links to guides, videos and more.
