## About custom repository roles

To perform any actions on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, such as creating a pull request in a repository or changing an organization's billing settings, a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. For example, the ability to delete an issue is a permission. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.

Within an organization, you can assign roles at the organization, team, and repository level. For more information about the different levels of roles, see "[Roles in an organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."

You can have more granular control over the permissions you grant at the repository level by creating up to three custom repository roles. {% data reusables.organizations.about-custom-repo-roles %} For more information, see "[Managing custom repository roles for an organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization).

After you create a custom role, anyone with admin access to a repository can assign the role to an individual or team. For more information, see "[Managing an individual's access to an organization repository](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-an-individuals-access-to-an-organization-repository)" and "[Managing team access to an organization repository](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)."

{% ifversion custom-repo-role-api %}

You can also use the REST API to create and manage custom repository roles. For more information, see "[Custom Repository Roles](/rest/orgs/custom-roles)."

{% else %}

You can also use the REST API to list the custom repository roles available in your organization. For more information, see "[Custom Repository Roles API](/rest/orgs/custom-roles)."

{% endif %}

## About the inherited role

When you create a custom repository role, you start by choosing an inherited role from a set of pre-defined options. The inherited role determines the initial set of permissions included in the custom role. Then, you can further customize the role by choosing additional permissions to give the role. For the full list of available permissions, see "[Additional permissions for custom roles](#additional-permissions-for-custom-roles)."

Your options for the inherited role are standardized for different types of contributors in your repository.

| Inherited role | Designed for |
|----|----|
| **Read** | Non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project |
| **Triage** | Contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access |
| **Write** | Organization members and collaborators who actively push to your project |
| **Maintain** | Project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions |

## Custom role examples

Here are some examples of custom repository roles you can configure.

| Custom repository role | Summary | Inherited role | Additional permissions |
|----|----|----|----|
| Security engineer | Able to contribute code and maintain the security pipeline | **Maintain** | Delete code scanning results |
| Contractor | Able to develop webhooks integrations | **Write** | Manage webhooks |
| Community manager | Able to handle all the community interactions without being able to contribute code | **Read** | - Mark an issue as duplicate <br> - Manage GitHub Page settings <br> - Manage wiki settings <br> - Set the social preview <br> - Edit repository metadata <br> - Triage discussions |

## Additional permissions for custom roles

After choosing an inherited role, you can select additional permissions for your custom role.

You can only choose an additional permission if it's not already included in the inherited role. For example, if the inherited role offers **Write** access to a repository, then the "Close a pull request" permission will already be included in the inherited role.

## Precedence for different levels of access

If a person is given different levels of access through different avenues, such as team membership and the base permissions for an organization, the highest access overrides the others. For example, if an organization owner gives an organization member a custom role that uses the "Read" inherited role, and then an organization owner sets the organization's base permission to "Write", then this custom role will have write access, along with any additional permissions included in the custom role.

{% data reusables.organizations.mixed-roles-warning %}

To resolve conflicting access, you can adjust your organization's base permissions or the team's access, or edit the custom role. For more information, see:
  - "[Setting base permissions for an organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/setting-base-permissions-for-an-organization)"
  - "[Managing team access to an organization repository](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)"
