## About outside collaborators

{% data reusables.organizations.about-outside-collaborators %} You can choose the level of access to grant for each outside collaborator. {% data reusables.organizations.outside_collaborator_forks %}

{% ifversion fpt %}
Organizations that use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} can restrict the ability to invite collaborators. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-organization-settings/setting-permissions-for-adding-outside-collaborators)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.

An organization owner can restrict the ability to invite collaborators. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/setting-permissions-for-adding-outside-collaborators)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghes %}
Before you can add someone as an outside collaborator on a repository, the person must have a personal account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. If your enterprise uses an external authentication system such as SAML or LDAP, the person you want to add must sign in through that system to create an account. If the person does not have access to the authentication system and built-in authentication is enabled for your enterprise, a site administrator can create an account for the person. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-built-in-authentication/configuring-built-in-authentication)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion not ghae %}
If your organization requires two-factor authentication, all outside collaborators must enable two-factor authentication before accepting your invitation to collaborate on a repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization)."

## Adding outside collaborators to a repository
