## About your organization's profile README

You can share information about how to engage with your organization by creating an organization profile README. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} shows your organization profile README in the "Overview" tab of your organization.

You can choose what information to include your organization profile README. Here are some examples of information that may be helpful in your organization's profile README.

- An "About" section that describes your organization
- Guidance for getting help in the organization

You can format text and include emoji, images, and GIFs in your organization profile README by using {% data variables.product.company_short %} Flavored Markdown. For more information, see "[Getting started with writing and formatting on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)."

## Adding an organization profile README

1. If your organization does not already have a public `.github` repository, create a public `.github` repository.
