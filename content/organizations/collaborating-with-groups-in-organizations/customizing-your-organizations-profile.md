## About your organization's profile page

{% ifversion org-profile-pin-private %}
You can customize your organization's Overview page to show content dedicated to public users or members of the organization. Members of your organization who are signed into {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, are shown a member view when they visit your organization's profile page. Users who are not members of your organization will be shown a public view.

### Pinned repositories

You can give users easy access to important or frequently used repositories, by choosing up to six repositories for public users and six repositories for members of the organization. Once you pin repositories to your organization profile, the "Pinned" section is shown above the "Repositories" section of the profile page.

Only organization owners can pin repositories. For more information, see "[Pinning repositories to your organization's profile](#pinning-repositories-to-your-organizations-profile)."

### Organization profile READMEs
{% endif %}

You can share information about how to engage with your organization by creating an organization profile README for both public users and members of the organization. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} shows your organization profile README in the "Overview" tab of your organization.

You can choose what information to include in your organization profile README. Here are some examples of information that may be helpful.

- An "About" section that describes your organization
- Guidance for getting help in the organization

You can format text and include emoji, images, and GIFs in your organization profile README by using {% data variables.product.company_short %} Flavored Markdown. For more information, see "[Getting started with writing and formatting on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)."

## Adding a public organization profile README

1. If your organization does not already have a public `.github` repository, create a public `.github` repository.
2. In your organization's `.github` repository, create a `README.md` file in the `profile` folder.
3. Commit the changes to the `README.md` file. The content of the `README.md` will appear on your organization's public profile.

{% ifversion org-profile-pin-private %}

## Adding a member-only organization profile README

1. If your organization does not already have a `.github-private` repository, create a private repository called `.github-private`. 
2. In your organization's `.github-private` repository, create a `README.md` file in the `profile` folder.
3. Commit the changes to the `README.md` file. The content of the `README.md` will be displayed in the member view of your organization's profile.

## Pinning repositories to your organization's profile

You can pin repositories that you want to feature, such as those that are frequently used, to your organization's profile page. To choose which repositories to pin to your organization's profile, you must be an organization owner.

1. Navigate to your organization's profile page.
2. In the right sidebar of the page in the {% octicon "eye" aria-label="The eye octicon" %} "View as" link, choose the **Public** or **Member** profile view from the dropdown menu.

   - If you haven't yet pinned any repositories to your organization's profile, you'll need to instead click **pin repositories** in the right sidebar of the profile page.
