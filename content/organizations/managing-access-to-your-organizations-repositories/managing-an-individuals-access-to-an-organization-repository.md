## About access to organization repositories

When you remove a collaborator from a repository in your organization, the collaborator loses special permissions, read access, write access, download access to the repository. If the repository is private and the collaborator has forked the repository, then their fork is also deleted, but the author will still retain any local clones of your repository.
