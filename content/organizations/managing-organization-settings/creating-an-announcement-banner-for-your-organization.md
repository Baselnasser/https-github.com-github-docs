You can create an announcement banner that will be displayed to all organization members at the top of every page in the organization.

{% data reusables.enterprise.user-messages-markdown %}

You can also set announcement banners at the enterprise level. For more information, see "[Customizing user messages for your enterprise](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/customizing-user-messages-for-your-enterprise)."

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
1. In the "Messages" section of the sidebar, click **{% octicon "megaphone" aria-label="The megaphone icon" %} Announcement**.
2. Under "Announcement", in the text field, type the announcement you want displayed in a banner.

3. Optionally, under "Expires on", select the calendar drop-down menu and click an expiration date.

   {% note %}

   **Note:** Announcements must either have an expiration date, be user dismissible, or both.

   {% endnote %}
