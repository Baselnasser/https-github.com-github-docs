Organization owners can manage the display of member names in an organization.

![Commenter's profile name displayed in comment](/assets/images/help/issues/commenter-full-name.png)

Each organization member chooses their own profile name in their settings. For more information, see "[Personalizing your profile](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/personalizing-your-profile#changing-your-profile-name)."

{% ifversion profile-name-enterprise-setting %}
You may not be able to configure this setting for your organization, if an enterprise owner has set a policy at the enterprise level. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."{% endif %}
