After you disable organization-wide project boards, it wonâ€™t be possible to create new project boards at the organization level, and any existing organization-level project boards will become inaccessible at their previous URLs. Project boards in repositories in the organization are not affected. {% ifversion projects-v2 %}These settings apply to {% data variables.projects.projects_v2 %} and {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_boards %}.{% endif %}

After you disable repository project boards in an organization, it won't be possible to create new project boards in any repositories in the organization, and any existing project boards in repositories in the organization will become inaccessible at their previous URLs. Project boards at the organization level are not affected.


When you disable project boards, you will no longer see project board information in timelines or [audit logs](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization).


{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.4 or ghae > 3.4 %}
1. In the "Code planning, and automation" section of the sidebar, click **{% octicon "table" aria-label="The table icon" %} Projects**.
{% endif %}

    - To disable organization-wide project boards, unselect **Enable projects for the organization**.
    - To disable repository project boards in the organization, unselect **Enable projects for all repositories**.
