permissions: Organization owners can allow project visibility changes for an organization.

You can restrict who has the ability to change the visibility of projects in your organization, such as restricting members from changing a project from private to public. 

You can limit the ability to change project visibility to just organization owners, or you can allow anyone with admin permissions on a project to change the visibility.
