## About transferring {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s

The owner of a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration can transfer ownership of the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to another user or organization. If an organization has designated any app managers for an app owned by the organization, the app managers can also transfer ownership of the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration. For more information about app managers, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/adding-and-removing-github-app-managers-in-your-organization)."

You can only transfer ownership to a user or organization. You cannot transfer ownership to a team.
