**Note**: If your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} is published on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, you must contact {% data variables.product.company_short %} Support and ask them to remove your app from {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} before you can delete your app. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/deleting-your-github-app-listing-from-github-marketplace)."

## Deleting a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}

{% data reusables.apps.settings-step %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.developer_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.github_apps %}
4. Select the GitHub App you want to delete.
{% data reusables.user-settings.github_apps_advanced %}
6. Click **Delete GitHub App**.
7. In the confirmation box, type the name of the GitHub App to confirm you want to delete it.
8. Click **I understand the consequences, delete this GitHub App**.

These steps only delete your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration, and all of the organization and account installations it may have. They do not delete any code that you wrote for your app. However, any code that relies on your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}'s credentials will no longer function.
