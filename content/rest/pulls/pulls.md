## About pull requests

You can list, view, edit, create, and merge pull requests using the REST API. For information about how to interact with comments on a pull request, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/issues/comments)."

Pull requests are a type of issue. Any actions that are available in both pull requests and issues, like managing assignees, labels, and milestones, are provided by the REST API to manage issues. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/issues)."

### Custom media types for pull requests

These are the supported media types for pull requests.

    application/vnd.github.raw+json
    application/vnd.github.text+json
    application/vnd.github.html+json
    application/vnd.github.full+json
    application/vnd.github.diff
