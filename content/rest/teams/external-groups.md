**Notes:** 

- The external groups API is only available for organizations that are part of a enterprise using {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}. For more information, see "[About Enterprise Managed Users](/admin/authentication/managing-your-enterprise-users-with-your-identity-provider/about-enterprise-managed-users)."
- If your organization uses team synchronization, you can use the Team Synchronization API. For more information, see "[Team synchronization API](#team-synchronization)."
