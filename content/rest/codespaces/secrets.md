## About {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} user secrets

You can create, list, and delete secrets (such as access tokens for cloud services) as well as assign secrets to repositories that the user has access to. These secrets are made available to the codespace at runtime. For more information, see "[Managing encrypted secrets for your codespaces](/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces)."
