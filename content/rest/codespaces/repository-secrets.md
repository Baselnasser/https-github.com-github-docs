## About the Codespaces repository secrets API

The Codespaces repository secrets API allows a user to create, list, and delete secrets (such as access tokens for cloud services) for repositories that the user has access to. These secrets are made available to the codespace at runtime. For more information, see "[Managing encrypted secrets for your codespaces](/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces)."
