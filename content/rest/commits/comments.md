## About commit comments

You can create, edit, and view commit comments using the REST API. A commit comment is a comment made on a specific commit. For more information, see "[Working with comments](/rest/guides/working-with-comments#commit-comments)."

### Custom media types for commit comments

These are the supported media types for commit comments. You can read more
about the use of media types in the API [here](/rest/overview/media-types).

    application/vnd.github-commitcomment.text+json
    application/vnd.github-commitcomment.html+json
    application/vnd.github-commitcomment.full+json
