{% ifversion api-date-versioning %}
## API version

Available resources may vary between REST API versions. You should use the `X-GitHub-Api-Version` header to specify an API version. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/overview/api-versions)."

{% endif %}

## Schema

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}All API access is over HTTPS, and{% else %}The API is{% endif %} accessed from `{% data variables.product.api_url_code %}`.  All data is
sent and received as JSON.

```shell
$ curl -I {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/users/octocat/orgs

> HTTP/2 200
> Server: nginx
> Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2012 23:33:14 GMT
> Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
> ETag: "a00049ba79152d03380c34652f2cb612"
> X-GitHub-Media-Type: github.v3
> x-ratelimit-limit: 5000
> x-ratelimit-remaining: 4987
> x-ratelimit-reset: 1350085394{% ifversion ghes %}
> X-GitHub-Enterprise-Version: {{ currentVersion | remove: "enterprise-server@" }}.0{% elsif ghae %}
> X-GitHub-Enterprise-Version: GitHub AE{% endif %}
> Content-Length: 5
> Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
> X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

Blank fields are included as `null` instead of being omitted.

All timestamps return in UTC time, ISO 8601 format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

For more information about timezones in timestamps, see [this section](#timezones).

### Summary representations

When you fetch a list of resources, the response includes a _subset_ of the
attributes for that resource. This is the "summary" representation of the
resource. (Some attributes are computationally expensive for the API to provide.
For performance reasons, the summary representation excludes those attributes.
To obtain those attributes, fetch the "detailed" representation.)

**Example**: When you get a list of repositories, you get the summary
representation of each repository. Here, we fetch the list of repositories owned
by the [octokit](https://github.com/octokit) organization:

    GET /orgs/octokit/repos

### Detailed representations

When you fetch an individual resource, the response typically includes _all_
attributes for that resource. This is the "detailed" representation of the
resource. (Note that authorization sometimes influences the amount of detail
included in the representation.)

**Example**: When you get an individual repository, you get the detailed
representation of the repository. Here, we fetch the
[octokit/octokit.rb](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) repository:

    GET /repos/octokit/octokit.rb

The documentation provides an example response for each API method. The example
response illustrates all attributes that are returned by that method.

## Authentication

{% data variables.product.company_short %} recommends that you create a token to authenticate to the REST API. For more information about which type of token to create, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api)."

You can authenticate your request by sending a token in the `Authorization` header of your request:

```shell
curl --request GET \
--url "{% data variables.product.api_url_code %}/octocat" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN"{% ifversion api-date-versioning %} \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: {{ allVersions[currentVersion].latestApiVersion }}"{% endif %}
```

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data reusables.getting-started.bearer-vs-token %}

{% endnote %}

If you try to use a REST API endpoint without a token or with a token that has insufficient permissions, you will receive a `404 Not Found` or `403 Forbidden` response.

{% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %}
### OAuth2 key/secret

{% data reusables.apps.deprecating_auth_with_query_parameters %}

```shell
curl -u my_client_id:my_client_secret '{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/user/repos'
```

Using your `client_id` and `client_secret` does _not_ authenticate as a user, it will only identify your {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} to increase your rate limit. Permissions are only granted to users, not applications, and you will only get back data that an unauthenticated user would see. Don't leak your {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}'s client secret to your users.

{% ifversion ghes %}
You will be unable to authenticate using your OAuth2 key and secret while in private mode, and trying to authenticate will return `401 Unauthorized`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-private-mode)".
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

Read [more about unauthenticated rate limiting](#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-apps).

{% endif %}

### Failed login limit

Authenticating with invalid credentials will return `401 Unauthorized`:

```shell
$ curl -I {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %} --header "Authorization: Bearer INVALID-TOKEN"
> HTTP/2 401

> {
>   "message": "Bad credentials",
>   "documentation_url": "{% data variables.product.doc_url_pre %}"
> }
```

After detecting several requests with invalid credentials within a short period,
the API will temporarily reject all authentication attempts for that user
(including ones with valid credentials) with `403 Forbidden`:

```shell
> HTTP/2 403
> {
>   "message": "Maximum number of login attempts exceeded. Please try again later.",
>   "documentation_url": "{% data variables.product.doc_url_pre %}"
> }
```

## Parameters

Many API methods take optional parameters. For `GET` requests, any parameters not
specified as a segment in the path can be passed as an HTTP query string
parameter:

```shell
$ curl -i "{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/vmg/redcarpet/issues?state=closed"
```

In this example, the 'vmg' and 'redcarpet' values are provided for the `:owner`
and `:repo` parameters in the path while `:state` is passed in the query
string.

For `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded as JSON
with a Content-Type of 'application/json':

```shell
$ curl -i --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" -d '{"scopes":["repo_deployment"]}' {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/authorizations
```

## Root endpoint

You can issue a `GET` request to the root endpoint to get all the endpoint categories that the REST API supports:

```shell
$ curl {% ifversion fpt or ghae or ghec %}
-u USERNAME:TOKEN {% endif %}{% ifversion ghes %}-u USERNAME:PASSWORD {% endif %}{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}
```

## GraphQL global node IDs

See the guide on "[AUTOTITLE](/graphql/guides/using-global-node-ids)" for detailed information about how to find `node_id`s via the REST API and use them in GraphQL operations.

## Client errors

There are three possible types of client errors on API calls that
receive request bodies:

1. Sending invalid JSON will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.

        HTTP/2 400
        Content-Length: 35

        {"message":"Problems parsing JSON"}

2. Sending the wrong type of JSON values will result in a `400 Bad
   Request` response.

        HTTP/2 400
        Content-Length: 40

        {"message":"Body should be a JSON object"}

3. Sending invalid fields will result in a `422 Unprocessable Entity`
   response.

        HTTP/2 422
        Content-Length: 149

        {
          "message": "Validation Failed",
          "errors": [
            {
              "resource": "Issue",
              "field": "title",
              "code": "missing_field"
            }
          ]
        }

All error objects have resource and field properties so that your client
can tell what the problem is.  There's also an error code to let you
know what is wrong with the field.

Error code | Description
-----------|-----------|
`missing` | A resource does not exist.
`missing_field` | A required field on a resource has not been set.
`invalid` | The formatting of a field is invalid.  Review the documentation for more specific information.
`already_exists` | Another resource has the same value as this field.  This can happen in resources that must have some unique key (such as label names).
`unprocessable` | The inputs provided were invalid.

Resources may also send custom validation errors (where `code` is `custom`). Custom errors will always have a `message` field describing the error, and most errors will also include a `documentation_url` field pointing to some content that might help you resolve the error.

## HTTP redirects

The {% data variables.product.product_name %} REST API uses HTTP redirection where appropriate. Clients should assume that any
request may result in a redirection. Receiving an HTTP redirection is *not* an
error and clients should follow that redirect. Redirect responses will have a
`Location` header field which contains the URI of the resource to which the
client should repeat the requests.

A `301` status code indicates permanent redirection. The URI you used to make the request has been superseded by the one specified in the `Location` header field. This and all future requests to this resource should be directed to the new URI.

A `302` or `307` status code indicates temporary redirection. The request should be repeated verbatim to the URI specified in the `Location` header field but clients should continue to use the original URI for future requests.

Other redirection status codes may be used in accordance with the HTTP 1.1 spec.

## HTTP verbs

Where possible, the {% data variables.product.product_name %} REST API strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each
action. Note that HTTP verbs are case-sensitive.

Verb | Description
-----|-----------
`HEAD` | Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.
`GET` | Used for retrieving resources.
`POST` | Used for creating resources.
`PATCH` | Used for updating resources with partial JSON data. For instance, an Issue resource has `title` and `body` attributes. A `PATCH` request may accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource.
`PUT` | Used for replacing resources or collections. For `PUT` requests with no `body` attribute, be sure to set the `Content-Length` header to zero.
`DELETE` |Used for deleting resources.

## Hypermedia

All resources may have one or more `*_url` properties linking to other
resources.  These are meant to provide explicit URLs so that proper API clients
don't need to construct URLs on their own.  It is highly recommended that API
clients use these.  Doing so will make future upgrades of the API easier for
developers.  All URLs are expected to be proper [RFC 6570][rfc] URI templates.

You can then expand these templates using something like the [uri_template][uri]
gem:

    >> tmpl = URITemplate.new('/notifications{?since,all,participating}')
    >> tmpl.expand
    => "/notifications"

    >> tmpl.expand all: 1
    => "/notifications?all=1"

    >> tmpl.expand all: 1, participating: 1
    => "/notifications?all=1&participating=1"

[rfc]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570
[uri]: https://github.com/hannesg/uri_template

## Pagination

When a response from the REST API would include many results, {% data variables.product.company_short %} will paginate the results and return a subset of the results. You can use the link header from the response to request additional pages of data. If an endpoint supports the `per_page` query parameter, then you can control how many results are returned on a page. For more information about pagination, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

## Timeouts

If {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} takes more than 10 seconds to process an API request, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will terminate the request and you will receive a timeout response like this:

```json
{
    "message": "Server Error"
}
```

{% data variables.product.product_name %} reserves the right to change the timeout window to protect the speed and reliability of the API.

## Rate limiting

The {% data variables.product.product_name %} REST API uses rate limiting to control API traffic. Different types of API requests have different rate limits. The response headers describe your current rate limit status.

### Rate limits

Different types of API requests to {% data variables.location.product_location %} are subject to different rate limits. Additionally, the Search endpoints have dedicated limits. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/search#rate-limit)" in the REST API documentation.

{% data reusables.enterprise.rate_limit %}


#### Rate limits for requests from personal accounts

You can make direct API requests that you authenticate with a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}. An {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} can also make a request on your behalf after you authorize the app. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)," "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps)," and "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps)."

{% data variables.product.product_name %} associates all of these requests with the authenticated user. For {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}, this is the user who authorized the app. All of these requests count toward the authenticated user's rate limit.

{% data reusables.apps.user-to-server-rate-limits %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

User access token requests are subject to a higher limit of 15,000 requests per hour and per authenticated user in the following scenarios:

- The request is from a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} that is owned by a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} organization.
- The request is from an {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} that is owned or approved by a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} organization.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes %}

For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows for up to 60 requests per hour. Unauthenticated requests are associated with the originating IP address, and not the person making requests.

{% endif %}

{% endif %}

#### Rate limits for requests from {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}

Requests from a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} may either use a user access token or an installation access token. For more information about rate limits for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/rate-limits-for-github-apps)."

#### Rate limits for requests from {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

You can use the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` to authenticate requests in GitHub Actions workflows. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)."

When using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the rate limit is 1,000 requests per hour per repository.{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} For requests to resources that belong to an enterprise account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}'s rate limit applies, and the limit is 15,000 requests per hour per repository.{% endif %}

### Checking your rate limit status

The response headers describe your current rate limit status. You can also use the REST API to find the current number of API calls available to you or your app at any given time.

#### Rate limit headers

The `x-ratelimit` response headers describe your current rate limit status following every request:

```shell
$ curl -i {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/users/octocat
> HTTP/2 200
> x-ratelimit-limit: 60
> x-ratelimit-remaining: 56
> x-ratelimit-used: 4
> x-ratelimit-reset: 1372700873
```

Header name | Description
-----------|-----------|
`x-ratelimit-limit` | The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per hour.
`x-ratelimit-remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
`x-ratelimit-used` | The number of requests you've made in the current rate limit window.
`x-ratelimit-reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in [UTC epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

#### Checking your rate limit status with the REST API

You can use the REST API to check your rate limit status without incurring a hit to the current limit. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/rate-limit)." When possible, {% data variables.product.company_short %} recommends using the `x-ratelimit` response headers instead to decrease load on the API.

### Exceeding the rate limit

If you exceed the rate limit, the response will have a `403` status and the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header will be `0`:

```shell
> HTTP/2 403
> Date: Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:50:41 GMT
> x-ratelimit-limit: 60
> x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
> x-ratelimit-used: 60
> x-ratelimit-reset: 1377013266

> {
>    "message": "API rate limit exceeded for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)",
>    "documentation_url": "{% data variables.product.doc_url_pre %}/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting"
> }
```

If you are rate limited, you should not try your request until after the time specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset` time.


### Increasing the unauthenticated rate limit for {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}

If your {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} needs to make unauthenticated calls to public resources at a higher rate limit, you can pass your app's client ID and secret before the endpoint route.

```shell
$ curl -u my_client_id:my_client_secret -I {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/meta
> HTTP/2 200
> Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2013 17:27:06 GMT
> x-ratelimit-limit: 5000
> x-ratelimit-remaining: 4966
> x-ratelimit-used: 34
> x-ratelimit-reset: 1372700873
```

{% note %}

**Note:** Never share your client secret with anyone or include it in client-side browser code.

{% endnote %}

### Staying within the rate limit

If you exceed your rate limit using Basic Authentication or OAuth, you can likely fix the issue by caching API responses and using [conditional requests](#conditional-requests).

### Secondary rate limits

The rate limits described above apply to the entire REST API and are per-user or per-app. In order to provide quality service on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, additional rate limits may apply to some actions when using the API. For example, using the API to rapidly create content, poll aggressively instead of using webhooks, make multiple concurrent requests, or repeatedly request data that is computationally expensive may result in additional rate limiting.

These additional rate limits are not intended to interfere with legitimate use of the API. Your normal rate limits should be the only limit you target. To ensure you're acting as a good API citizen, check out our [Best Practices guidelines](/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators).

If your application triggers an additional rate limit, you'll receive an informative response:

```shell
> HTTP/2 403
> Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
> Connection: close

> {
>   "message": "You have exceeded a secondary rate limit and have been temporarily blocked from content creation. Please retry your request again later.",
>   "documentation_url": "{% data variables.product.doc_url_pre %}/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits"
> }
```

You should wait and try your request at a later time. If the `retry-after` response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed. If the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header is `0`, you should not retry your request until after the time, in UTC epoch seconds, specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset` header. Otherwise, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

## User agent required

All API requests MUST include a valid `User-Agent` header. Requests with no `User-Agent`
header will be rejected. We request that you use your {% data variables.product.product_name %} username, or the name of your
application, for the `User-Agent` header value. This allows us to contact you if there are problems.

Here's an example:

```shell
User-Agent: Awesome-Octocat-App
```

curl sends a valid `User-Agent` header by default. If you provide an invalid `User-Agent` header via curl (or via an alternative client), you will receive a `403 Forbidden` response:

```shell
$ curl -IH 'User-Agent: ' {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/meta
> HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
> Connection: close
> Content-Type: text/html

> Request forbidden by administrative rules.
> Please make sure your request has a User-Agent header.
> Check  for other possible causes.
```

{% endif %}

## Conditional requests

Most responses return an `ETag` header. Many responses also return a `Last-Modified` header. You can use the values
of these headers to make subsequent requests to those resources using the
`If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers, respectively. If the resource
has not changed, the server will return a `304 Not Modified`.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% tip %}

**Note**: Making a conditional request and receiving a 304 response does not
count against your [Rate Limit](#rate-limiting), so we encourage you to use it
whenever possible.

{% endtip %}

{% endif %}

```shell
$ curl -I {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/user
> HTTP/2 200
> Cache-Control: private, max-age=60
> ETag: "644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730"
> Last-Modified: Thu, 05 Jul 2012 15:31:30 GMT

> x-ratelimit-reset: 1372700873

$ curl -I {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/user -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 05 Jul 2012 15:31:30 GMT"
> HTTP/2 304
> Cache-Control: private, max-age=60
> Last-Modified: Thu, 05 Jul 2012 15:31:30 GMT
> Vary: Accept, Authorization, Cookie
> x-ratelimit-limit: 5000
> x-ratelimit-remaining: 4996
> x-ratelimit-reset: 1372700873
```

## Cross origin resource sharing

The API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from
any origin.
You can read the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/), or
[this intro](https://code.google.com/archive/p/html5security/wikis/CrossOriginRequestSecurity.wiki) from the
HTML 5 Security Guide.

Here's a sample request sent from a browser hitting
`http://example.com`:

```shell
$ curl -I {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %} -H "Origin: http://example.com"
HTTP/2 302
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-GitHub-OTP, x-ratelimit-limit, x-ratelimit-remaining, x-ratelimit-reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval
```

This is what the CORS preflight request looks like:

```shell
$ curl -I {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %} -H "Origin: http://example.com" -X OPTIONS
HTTP/2 204
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, If-Match, If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Unmodified-Since, X-GitHub-OTP, X-Requested-With
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-GitHub-OTP, x-ratelimit-limit, x-ratelimit-remaining, x-ratelimit-reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

## JSON-P callbacks

You can send a `?callback` parameter to any GET call to have the results
wrapped in a JSON function.  This is typically used when browsers want
to embed {% data variables.product.product_name %} content in web pages by getting around cross domain
issues.  The response includes the same data output as the regular API,
plus the relevant HTTP Header information.

```shell
$ curl {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}?callback=foo

> /**/foo({
>   "meta": {
>     "status": 200,
>     "x-ratelimit-limit": "5000",
>     "x-ratelimit-remaining": "4966",
>     "x-ratelimit-reset": "1372700873",
>     "Link": [ // pagination headers and other links
>       ["{% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}?page=2", {"rel": "next"}]
>     ]
>   },
>   "data": {
>     // the data
>   }
> })
```

You can write a JavaScript handler to process the callback. Here's a minimal example you can try out:

    <html>
    <head>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    function foo(response) {
      var meta = response.meta;
      var data = response.data;
      console.log(meta);
      console.log(data);
    }

    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = '{% data variables.product.api_url_code %}?callback=foo';

    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
    </script>
    </head>

    <body>
      <p>Open up your browser's console.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

All of the headers are the same String value as the HTTP Headers with one
notable exception: Link.  Link headers are pre-parsed for you and come
through as an array of `[url, options]` tuples.

A link that looks like this:

    Link: <url1>; rel="next", <url2>; rel="foo"; bar="baz"

... will look like this in the Callback output:

```json
{
  "Link": [
    [
      "url1",
      {
        "rel": "next"
      }
    ],
    [
      "url2",
      {
        "rel": "foo",
        "bar": "baz"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Timezones

Some requests that create new data, such as creating a new commit, allow you to provide time zone information when specifying or generating timestamps. We apply the following rules, in order of priority, to determine timezone information for such API calls.

* [Explicitly providing an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information](#explicitly-providing-an-iso-8601-timestamp-with-timezone-information)

Note that these rules apply only to data passed to the API, not to data returned by the API. As mentioned in "[Schema](#schema)," timestamps returned by the API are in UTC time, ISO 8601 format.

### Explicitly providing an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information

For API calls that allow for a timestamp to be specified, we use that exact timestamp. An example of this is the API to manage commits. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/git#commits)."

These timestamps look something like `2014-02-27T15:05:06+01:00`. Also see [this example](/rest/git#example-input) for how these timestamps can be specified.

### Using the `Time-Zone` header

It is possible to supply a `Time-Zone` header which defines a timezone according to the [list of names from the Olson database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

```shell
$ curl -H "Time-Zone: Europe/Amsterdam" -X POST {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/repos/github-linguist/linguist/contents/new_file.md
```

This means that we generate a timestamp for the moment your API call is made in the timezone this header defines. For example, the API to manage contents generates a git commit for each addition or change and uses the current time as the timestamp. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/repos#contents)." This header will determine the timezone used for generating that current timestamp.

### Using the last known timezone for the user

If no `Time-Zone` header is specified and you make an authenticated call to the API, we use the last known timezone for the authenticated user. The last known timezone is updated whenever you browse the {% data variables.product.product_name %} website.

### Defaulting to UTC without other timezone information

If the steps above don't result in any information, we use UTC as the timezone to create the git commit.
