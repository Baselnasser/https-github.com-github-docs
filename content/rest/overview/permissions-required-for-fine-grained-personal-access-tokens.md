## About permissions required for {% data variables.product.pat_v2 %}

When you create a {% data variables.product.pat_v2 %}, you grant it a set of permissions. Permissions define what resources the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} can access via the API. For more information, see "[Creating a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)."
