## About the Organization migrations API

The Migrations API is only available to authenticated organization owners. For more information, see "[Roles in an organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#permission-levels-for-an-organization)" and "[Other authentication methods](/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods)."
