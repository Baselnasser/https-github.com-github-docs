## About the Management Console

{% tip %}

You should explicitly set the port number when making API calls to the Management Console. If TLS is enabled on your enterprise, the port number is `8443`. Otherwise, the port number is `8080`.

If you cannot provide a port number, you'll need to configure your tool to automatically follow redirects.

You may also need to add the [`-k` flag](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-k) when using `curl`, since {% data variables.product.product_name %} uses a self-signed certificate before you [add your own TLS certificate](/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-tls).

{% endtip %}

### Authentication

You need to pass your [Management Console password](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console) as an authentication token to every endpoint in this category except ["Create a license"](#create-a-github-enterprise-server-license).

Use the `api_key` parameter to send this token with each request. For example:

```shell
$ curl -L 'https://HOSTNAME:ADMIN-PORT/setup/api?api_key=YOUR_PASSWORD'
```

You can also use standard HTTP authentication to send this token. For example:

```shell
$ curl -L -u "api_key:YOUR_PASSWORD" 'https://HOSTNAME:ADMIN-PORT/setup/api'
```
