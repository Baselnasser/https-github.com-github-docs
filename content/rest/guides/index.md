This section of the documentation is intended to get you up-and-running with
real-world {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}{% else %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% endif %} API applications. We'll go over everything you need to know, from authentication to results manipulation to integrating results with other apps.
Every tutorial will include a project, and each project will be saved and documented in our public
[platform-samples](https://github.com/github/platform-samples) repository.
