Feature and Function Overview																											
	Depending on the ADP Payments package you select, all of the features listed here may not be available in your system.																										
																											
The following functions are available in ADP Payments:																											
																											
Echeck (ACH) Payment Processing — Funds are debited directly from your customer's bank account and deposited into yours.																											
																											
Credit Card Processing — Process credit cards at industry-low rates. Charge a customer’s American Express, Visa, MasterCard, or Discover card, or credit a customer’s account for a refund due.																											
																											
Recurring Payment Scheduling — Create an automated schedule for the system to automatically charge your customer (using an Echeck (ACH) or Credit Card transaction) a pre-determined amount on a pre-determined schedule. The system provides two types of recurring payment schedules:																											
																											
Recurring Billing Schedule — A schedule that charges a customer a pre-determined amount on the frequency defined by the schedule.																											
																											
Payment Plan Schedule — A schedule based on a total amount due, for which you program a specific number of payments. The system charges your customer on the frequency set, and keeps track of the customer’s payments until the total amount is collected.																											
																											
Invoicing — Send an invoice to your customer that contains a button that seamlessly transfers the customer to a secure online payment form from which he can make a payment. The system supports two types of invoice:																											
																											
One-time Invoices — Invoices that get e-mailed to your customer once.																											
																											
Invoice Schedules — Invoices that get e-mailed to your customer automatically by the system, on the schedule you set.																											
																											
Reporting — Use standard and custom reports to monitor deposits, outstanding and paid invoices, and successful and failed transactions.																											
																											
Online Payments — Use securely hosted ADP Payments Web Payment Pages branded for your company to accept payments online from links in your website, invoices, or other emails.																											
																											
If you would like to activate a function for which your system is not yet enabled, please contact Customer Care at ADPPaymentsSupport@paysimple.comor 800-297-5341.

Web Payment Pages																											
																											
Web Payment Pages are securely hosted web pages that your customers can use to make payments for online purchases, order services, or pay their bills online. They can also be used to enable your customers to enter their own recurring payment schedules online.																											
																											
ADP Payments Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons are accessed from the web payment pages tab in the Settings section.																											
																											
The top section of the screen displays a table of Web Payment Pages, and the bottom section displays a table of Web Payment Buttons.																											
																											
	"Web Payment Pages are designed for payments that are not associated with ADP Payments invoices.

When customers click a “PAY INVOICE NOW” button in an emailed invoice, they are taken to a special ADP Payments online invoice screen that contains full invoice details.

Web Payment Pages cannot contain detailed Line Items and Taxes as invoices do. They can be used only for payment of a “Total” amount, and provide no details about the individual items included in the total."																										
																											
You can link to ADP Payments Web Payment Pages from anywhere on your website. You can also include links to these pages in promotional or marketing emails to customers. Additionally, you can include the urls for your Web Payment Pages in printed advertising and marketing materials you send to customers. When you do this, customers can go online and make purchases in response to your printed offer.																											
																											
To make linking to Web Payment Pages easier, ADP Payments provides the ability to create Web Payment Buttons. You design the buttons and select the Web Payment Page to which you want them linked. Buttons can be a graphic, or a standard text link. Once the button is configured, simply export the code and paste it into any page on your website.																											
																											
To help you start accepting online payments immediately, your ADP Payments account is configured with a default Web Payment Page and a default Web Payment Button. These can be used as is, or you can edit them as needed. You can also add as many additional Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons as you like.																											
																											
The following sections provide detailed information about creating, editing, and managing ADP Payments Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons.

	View Saved Payment Accounts																										
																											
	The Select Account screen lists all credit cards and bank accounts (ACH accounts) saved as part of a Customer Record. It is accessed by tapping the PAYMENT METHODS bar on a Customer Details screen.																										
	NOTE: You cannot access the view account function from the Select Account screen opened from the Collect Payment screen. This function (indicated by the > at the far right of each account bar), is only accessible when this screen is accessed from the PAYMENT METHODS bar on a Customer Details screen.																										
																											
	The top Credit Card Accounts list includes the following components for each card:																										
																											
	Card type icon																										
																											
	Masked card number (the last 4 digits of the card are shown)																										
																											
	Expiration date																										
																											
	Default account indicator: This is a check in a green circle to the far right of the credit card account row. For example, the MasterCard ending in 5454 is the default account.																										
																											
	The bottom ACH Accounts list includes the following components for each bank account:																										
																											
	ACH icon																										
	NOTE: The same icon is used for checking and savings accounts.																										
																											
	Bank Name																										
																											
	Masked bank account number (the last 4 digits of the card are shown)																										
																											
	Default account indicator: This is a check in a green circle at the top of the type icon. For example, in the above screen capture, the Test Bank account ending in 6666 is the default account.																										
		The Default Credit Card and Default Bank Account cannot be changed from the Mobile App, though they can be changed from the web-based UI. However, if there are no current credit cards saved with the Customer Record and you add the first from the Mobile App, it will be saved as the default; and if there are no current bank accounts saved with the Customer Record and you add the first from the Mobile App, it will be saved as the default.																									
																											
	Tap any of the accounts in a list to view complete account details on a Credit Card details screen or an ACH Account details screen.																										
	NOTE: Credit Card numbers and Bank Account numbers will always be masked to display only the last four digits. As with the web-based UI, there is no way to view the full number.																										
																											
	Tap the back arrow to return to the Select Account screen from a details screen.																										
																											
	You can tap the Actions icon, located in the top-right corner of a details screen, to delete the account. This process is described in the next section.

		Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions																									
																											
		Obtaining the proper authorization for the transactions you process, in conjunction with implementing strong fraud prevention policies, are the most important steps you can take to protect yourself against disputes, return fees, and chargebacks.																									
																											
		Authorizations protect both you and your customers. They provide a record of your customer's approval of a transaction, and they enable you to provide proof that you had permission to process a transaction in the event that your customer later claims the transaction was not authorized.																									
																											
		Implementing security policies and card authorization procedures designed to detect fraudulent transactions before they are processed prevents the significant time involved in defending a disputed charge, and saves you the substantial fees assessed for chargebacks (not to mention the money you lose on the original transaction itself).																									
																											
		The following sections provide guidance on how to obtain the proper authorization for one-time and recurring Echeck (ACH) and credit card transactions, help for understanding and preventing chargebacks, and tips on using the fraud prevention tools available to you as part of ADP Payments.																									
																											
		Also provided are authorization form templates that can be customized for your business when it needs to obtain written authorizations. When using the templates, enter your business information in all the red entry fields—for example where you see <Insert Business Name>, you would remove that text, type your business name, and change the font color to black.																									
																											
		The following sections provide details on how to authorize credit card and Echeck (ACH) transactions, in addition to sample language and templates you can use for authorization forms, receipts, and terms and conditions. You can click on the Next links, located at the bottom of each screen, to read through the entire section.

		Feature and Function Overview																									
			Depending on the ADP Payments package you select, all of the features listed here may not be available in your system.																								
																											
		The following functions are available in ADP Payments:																									
																											
		Echeck (ACH) Payment Processing — Funds are debited directly from your customer's bank account and deposited into yours.																									
																											
		Credit Card Processing — Process credit cards at industry-low rates. Charge a customer’s American Express, Visa, MasterCard, or Discover card, or credit a customer’s account for a refund due.																									
																											
		Recurring Payment Scheduling — Create an automated schedule for the system to automatically charge your customer (using an Echeck (ACH) or Credit Card transaction) a pre-determined amount on a pre-determined schedule. The system provides two types of recurring payment schedules:																									
																											
		Recurring Billing Schedule — A schedule that charges a customer a pre-determined amount on the frequency defined by the schedule.																									
																											
		Payment Plan Schedule — A schedule based on a total amount due, for which you program a specific number of payments. The system charges your customer on the frequency set, and keeps track of the customer’s payments until the total amount is collected.																									
																											
		Invoicing — Send an invoice to your customer that contains a button that seamlessly transfers the customer to a secure online payment form from which he can make a payment. The system supports two types of invoice:																									
																											
		One-time Invoices — Invoices that get e-mailed to your customer once.																									
																											
		Invoice Schedules — Invoices that get e-mailed to your customer automatically by the system, on the schedule you set.																									
																											
		Reporting — Use standard and custom reports to monitor deposits, outstanding and paid invoices, and successful and failed transactions.																									
																											
		Online Payments — Use securely hosted ADP Payments Web Payment Pages branded for your company to accept payments online from links in your website, invoices, or other emails.																									
																											
		If you would like to activate a function for which your system is not yet enabled, please contact Customer Care at ADPPaymentsSupport@paysimple.comor 800-297-5341.

		Web Payment Pages																									
																											
		Web Payment Pages are securely hosted web pages that your customers can use to make payments for online purchases, order services, or pay their bills online. They can also be used to enable your customers to enter their own recurring payment schedules online.																									
																											
		ADP Payments Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons are accessed from the web payment pages tab in the Settings section.																									
																											
		The top section of the screen displays a table of Web Payment Pages, and the bottom section displays a table of Web Payment Buttons.																									
																											
			"Web Payment Pages are designed for payments that are not associated with ADP Payments invoices.

When customers click a “PAY INVOICE NOW” button in an emailed invoice, they are taken to a special ADP Payments online invoice screen that contains full invoice details.

Web Payment Pages cannot contain detailed Line Items and Taxes as invoices do. They can be used only for payment of a “Total” amount, and provide no details about the individual items included in the total."																								
																											
		You can link to ADP Payments Web Payment Pages from anywhere on your website. You can also include links to these pages in promotional or marketing emails to customers. Additionally, you can include the urls for your Web Payment Pages in printed advertising and marketing materials you send to customers. When you do this, customers can go online and make purchases in response to your printed offer.																									
																											
		To make linking to Web Payment Pages easier, ADP Payments provides the ability to create Web Payment Buttons. You design the buttons and select the Web Payment Page to which you want them linked. Buttons can be a graphic, or a standard text link. Once the button is configured, simply export the code and paste it into any page on your website.																									
																											
		To help you start accepting online payments immediately, your ADP Payments account is configured with a default Web Payment Page and a default Web Payment Button. These can be used as is, or you can edit them as needed. You can also add as many additional Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons as you like.

			View Saved Payment Accounts																								
																											
			The Select Account screen lists all credit cards and bank accounts (ACH accounts) saved as part of a Customer Record. It is accessed by tapping the PAYMENT METHODS bar on a Customer Details screen.																								
			NOTE: You cannot access the view account function from the Select Account screen opened from the Collect Payment screen. This function (indicated by the > at the far right of each account bar), is only accessible when this screen is accessed from the PAYMENT METHODS bar on a Customer Details screen.																								
																											
			The top Credit Card Accounts list includes the following components for each card:																								
																											
			Card type icon																								
																											
			Masked card number (the last 4 digits of the card are shown)																								
																											
			Expiration date																								
																											
			Default account indicator: This is a check in a green circle to the far right of the credit card account row. For example, the MasterCard ending in 5454 is the default account.																								
																											
			The bottom ACH Accounts list includes the following components for each bank account:																								
																											
			ACH icon																								
			NOTE: The same icon is used for checking and savings accounts.																								
																											
			Bank Name																								
																											
			Masked bank account number (the last 4 digits of the card are shown)																								
																											
			Default account indicator: This is a check in a green circle at the top of the type icon. For example, in the above screen capture, the Test Bank account ending in 6666 is the default account.																								
				The Default Credit Card and Default Bank Account cannot be changed from the Mobile App, though they can be changed from the web-based UI. However, if there are no current credit cards saved with the Customer Record and you add the first from the Mobile App, it will be saved as the default; and if there are no current bank accounts saved with the Customer Record and you add the first from the Mobile App, it will be saved as the default.																							
																											
			Tap any of the accounts in a list to view complete account details on a Credit Card details screen or an ACH Account details screen.																								
			NOTE: Credit Card numbers and Bank Account numbers will always be masked to display only the last four digits. As with the web-based UI, there is no way to view the full number.																								
																											
			Tap the back arrow to return to the Select Account screen from a details screen.																								
																											
			You can tap the Actions icon, located in the top-right corner of a details screen, to delete the account. This process is described in the next section.

				Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions																							
																											
				Obtaining the proper authorization for the transactions you process, in conjunction with implementing strong fraud prevention policies, are the most important steps you can take to protect yourself against disputes, return fees, and chargebacks.																							
																											
				Authorizations protect both you and your customers. They provide a record of your customer's approval of a transaction, and they enable you to provide proof that you had permission to process a transaction in the event that your customer later claims the transaction was not authorized.																							
																											
				Implementing security policies and card authorization procedures designed to detect fraudulent transactions before they are processed prevents the significant time involved in defending a disputed charge, and saves you the substantial fees assessed for chargebacks (not to mention the money you lose on the original transaction itself).																							
																											
				The following sections provide guidance on how to obtain the proper authorization for one-time and recurring Echeck (ACH) and credit card transactions, help for understanding and preventing chargebacks, and tips on using the fraud prevention tools available to you as part of ADP Payments.																							
																											
				Also provided are authorization form templates that can be customized for your business when it needs to obtain written authorizations. When using the templates, enter your business information in all the red entry fields—for example where you see <Insert Business Name>, you would remove that text, type your business name, and change the font color to black.																							
																											
				The following sections provide details on how to authorize credit card and Echeck (ACH) transactions, in addition to sample language and templates you can use for authorization forms, receipts, and terms and conditions. You can click on the Next links, located at the bottom of each screen, to read through the entire section.

				Feature and Function Overview																							
					Depending on the ADP Payments package you select, all of the features listed here may not be available in your system.																						
																											
				The following functions are available in ADP Payments:																							
																											
				Echeck (ACH) Payment Processing — Funds are debited directly from your customer's bank account and deposited into yours.																							
																											
				Credit Card Processing — Process credit cards at industry-low rates. Charge a customer’s American Express, Visa, MasterCard, or Discover card, or credit a customer’s account for a refund due.																							
																											
				Recurring Payment Scheduling — Create an automated schedule for the system to automatically charge your customer (using an Echeck (ACH) or Credit Card transaction) a pre-determined amount on a pre-determined schedule. The system provides two types of recurring payment schedules:																							
																											
				Recurring Billing Schedule — A schedule that charges a customer a pre-determined amount on the frequency defined by the schedule.																							
																											
				Payment Plan Schedule — A schedule based on a total amount due, for which you program a specific number of payments. The system charges your customer on the frequency set, and keeps track of the customer’s payments until the total amount is collected.																							
																											
				Invoicing — Send an invoice to your customer that contains a button that seamlessly transfers the customer to a secure online payment form from which he can make a payment. The system supports two types of invoice:																							
																											
				One-time Invoices — Invoices that get e-mailed to your customer once.																							
																											
				Invoice Schedules — Invoices that get e-mailed to your customer automatically by the system, on the schedule you set.																							
																											
				Reporting — Use standard and custom reports to monitor deposits, outstanding and paid invoices, and successful and failed transactions.																							
																											
				Online Payments — Use securely hosted ADP Payments Web Payment Pages branded for your company to accept payments online from links in your website, invoices, or other emails.																							
																											
				If you would like to activate a function for which your system is not yet enabled, please contact Customer Care at ADPPaymentsSupport@paysimple.comor 800-297-5341.

				Web Payment Pages																							
																											
				Web Payment Pages are securely hosted web pages that your customers can use to make payments for online purchases, order services, or pay their bills online. They can also be used to enable your customers to enter their own recurring payment schedules online.																							
																											
				ADP Payments Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons are accessed from the web payment pages tab in the Settings section.																							
																											
				The top section of the screen displays a table of Web Payment Pages, and the bottom section displays a table of Web Payment Buttons.																							
																											
					"Web Payment Pages are designed for payments that are not associated with ADP Payments invoices.

When customers click a “PAY INVOICE NOW” button in an emailed invoice, they are taken to a special ADP Payments online invoice screen that contains full invoice details.

Web Payment Pages cannot contain detailed Line Items and Taxes as invoices do. They can be used only for payment of a “Total” amount, and provide no details about the individual items included in the total."																						
																											
				You can link to ADP Payments Web Payment Pages from anywhere on your website. You can also include links to these pages in promotional or marketing emails to customers. Additionally, you can include the urls for your Web Payment Pages in printed advertising and marketing materials you send to customers. When you do this, customers can go online and make purchases in response to your printed offer.																							
																											
				To make linking to Web Payment Pages easier, ADP Payments provides the ability to create Web Payment Buttons. You design the buttons and select the Web Payment Page to which you want them linked. Buttons can be a graphic, or a standard text link. Once the button is configured, simply export the code and paste it into any page on your website.																							
																											
				To help you start accepting online payments immediately, your ADP Payments account is configured with a default Web Payment Page and a default Web Payment Button. These can be used as is, or you can edit them as needed. You can also add as many additional Web Payment Pages and Web Payment Buttons as you like.

					View Saved Payment Accounts																						
																											
					The Select Account screen lists all credit cards and bank accounts (ACH accounts) saved as part of a Customer Record. It is accessed by tapping the PAYMENT METHODS bar on a Customer Details screen.																						
					NOTE: You cannot access the view account function from the Select Account screen opened from the Collect Payment screen. This function (indicated by the > at the far right of each account bar), is only accessible when this screen is accessed from the PAYMENT METHODS bar on a Customer Details screen.																						
																											
					The top Credit Card Accounts list includes the following components for each card:																						
																											
					Card type icon																						
																											
					Masked card number (the last 4 digits of the card are shown)																						
																											
					Expiration date																						
																											
					Default account indicator: This is a check in a green circle to the far right of the credit card account row. For example, the MasterCard ending in 5454 is the default account.																						
																											
					The bottom ACH Accounts list includes the following components for each bank account:																						
																											
					ACH icon																						
					NOTE: The same icon is used for checking and savings accounts.																						
																											
					Bank Name																						
																											
					Masked bank account number (the last 4 digits of the card are shown)																						
																											
					Default account indicator: This is a check in a green circle at the top of the type icon. For example, in the above screen capture, the Test Bank account ending in 6666 is the default account.																						
						The Default Credit Card and Default Bank Account cannot be changed from the Mobile App, though they can be changed from the web-based UI. However, if there are no current credit cards saved with the Customer Record and you add the first from the Mobile App, it will be saved as the default; and if there are no current bank accounts saved with the Customer Record and you add the first from the Mobile App, it will be saved as the default.																					
																											
					Tap any of the accounts in a list to view complete account details on a Credit Card details screen or an ACH Account details screen.																						
					NOTE: Credit Card numbers and Bank Account numbers will always be masked to display only the last four digits. As with the web-based UI, there is no way to view the full number.																						
																											
					Tap the back arrow to return to the Select Account screen from a details screen.																						
																											
					You can tap the Actions icon, located in the top-right corner of a details screen, to delete the account. This process is described in the next section.

						Appendix A: Authorizing Transactions																					
																											
						Obtaining the proper authorization for the transactions you process, in conjunction with implementing strong fraud prevention policies, are the most important steps you can take to protect yourself against disputes, return fees, and chargebacks.																					
																											
						Authorizations protect both you and your customers. They provide a record of your customer's approval of a transaction, and they enable you to provide proof that you had permission to process a transaction in the event that your customer later claims the transaction was not authorized.																					
																											
						Implementing security policies and card authorization procedures designed to detect fraudulent transactions before they are processed prevents the significant time involved in defending a disputed charge, and saves you the substantial fees assessed for chargebacks (not to mention the money you lose on the original transaction itself).																					
																											
						The following sections provide guidance on how to obtain the proper authorization for one-time and recurring Echeck (ACH) and credit card transactions, help for understanding and preventing chargebacks, and tips on using the fraud prevention tools available to you as part of ADP Payments.																					
																											
						Also provided are authorization form templates that can be customized for your business when it needs to obtain written authorizations. When using the templates, enter your business information in all the red entry fields—for example where you see <Insert Business Name>, you would remove that text, type your business name, and change the font color to black.																					
																											
						The following sections provide details on how to authorize credit card and Echeck (ACH) transactions, in addition to sample language and templates you can use for authorization forms, receipts, and terms and conditions. You can click on the Next links, located at the bottom of each screen, to read through the entire section.

						Feature and Function Overview																					
							Depending on the ADP Payments package you select, all of the features listed here may not be available in your system.																				
																											
						The following functions are available in ADP Payments:																					
																											
						Echeck (ACH) Payment Processing — Funds are debited directly from your customer's bank account and deposited into yours.																					
																											
						Credit Card Processing — Process credit cards at industry-low rates. Charge a customer’s American Express, Visa, MasterCard, or Discover card, or credit a customer’s account for a refund due.																					
																											
						Recurring Payment Scheduling — Create an automated schedule for the system to automatically charge your customer (using an Echeck (ACH) or Credit Card transaction) a pre-determined amount on a pre-determined schedule. The system provides two types of recurring payment schedules:																					
																											
						Recurring Billing Schedule — A schedule that charges a customer a pre-determined amount on the frequency defined by the schedule.																					
																											
						Payment Plan Schedule — A schedule based on a total amount due, for which you program a specific number of payments. The system charges your customer on the frequency set, and keeps track of the customer’s payments until the total amount is collected.																					
																											
						Invoicing — Send an invoice to your customer that contains a button that seamlessly transfers the customer to a secure online payment form from which he can make a payment. The system supports two types of invoice:																					
																											
						One-time Invoices — Invoices that get e-mailed to your customer once.																					
																											
						Invoice Schedules — Invoices that get e-mailed to your customer automatically by the system, on the schedule you set.																					
																											
						Reporting — Use standard and custom reports to monitor deposits, outstanding and paid invoices, and successful and failed transactions.

							"Web Payment Pages are designed for payments that are not associated with ADP Payments invoices.

When customers click a “PAY INVOICE NOW” button in an emailed invoice, they are taken to a special ADP Payments online invoice screen that contains full invoice details.

Web Payment Pages cannot contain detailed Line Items and Taxes as invoices do. They can be used only for payment of a “Total” amount, and provide no details about the individual items included in the total."																				
																											
						You can link to ADP Payments Web Payment Pages from anywhere on your website. You can also include links to these pages in promotional or marketing emails to customers. Additionally, you can include the urls for your Web Payment Pages in printed advertising and marketing materials you send to customers. When you do this, customers can go online and make purchases in response to your printed offer.																					
																											
						To make linking to Web Payment Pages easier, ADP Payments provides the ability to create Web Payment Buttons. You design the buttons and select the Web Payment Page to which you want them linked. Buttons can be a graphic, or a standard text link. Once the button is configured, simply export the code and paste it into any page on your website.																					
																											
						To help you start accepting online payments immediately, your ADP Payments account is configured with a default Web Payment Page and a default Web Payment Button.

The [Deployments API][deploy API] provides your projects hosted on {% data variables.product.product_name %} with
the capability to launch them on a server that you own. Combined with
[the Status API][status API], you'll be able to coordinate your deployments
the moment your code lands on the default branch.

This guide will use that API to demonstrate a setup that you can use.
In our scenario, we will:

* Merge a pull request
* When the CI is finished, we'll set the pull request's status accordingly.
* When the pull request is merged, we'll run our deployment to our server.

Our CI system and host server will be figments of our imagination. They could be
Heroku, Amazon, or something else entirely. The crux of this guide will be setting up
and configuring the server managing the communication.

If you haven't already, be sure to [download ngrok][ngrok], and learn how
to [use it][using ngrok]. We find it to be a very useful tool for exposing local
connections.

Note: you can download the complete source code for this project
[from the platform-samples repo][platform samples].

## Writing your server

We'll write a quick Sinatra app to prove that our local connections are working.
Let's start with this:

``` ruby
require 'sinatra'

require 'json'

post '/event_handler' do
  payload = JSON.parse(params[:payload/do.]

(If you're unfamiliar with how Sinatra works, we recommend [reading the Sinatra guide][Sinatra].)

Start this server up. By default, Sinatra starts on port `4567`, so you'll want
to configure ngrok to start listening for that, too.

In order for this server to work, we'll need to set a repository up with a webhook.
The webhook should be configured to fire whenever a pull request is created, or merged.
Go ahead and create a repository you're comfortable playing around in. Might we
suggest [@octocat's Spoon/Knife repository](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife)?
After that, you'll create a new webhook in your repository, feeding it the URL
that ngrok gave you, and choosing `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` as the
content type:

![A new ngrok URL](/assets/images/webhook_sample_url.png)

Click **Update webhook**. You should see a body response of `Well, it worked!`.
Great! Click on **Let me select individual events.**, and select the following:

* Deployment
* Deployment status
* Pull Request

These are the events {% data variables.product.product_name %} will send to our server whenever the relevant action
occurs. We'll configure our server to *just* handle when pull requests are merged
right now:

``` ruby
post '/event_handler' do
  @payload = JSON.parse(params[:payload])

  case request.env['HTTP_X_GITHUB_EVENT']
  when "pull_request"
    if @payload["action"] == "closed" && @payload["pull_request"]["merged"]
      puts "A pull request was merged! A deployment should start now..."
    end
  end
end
```

What's going on? Every event that {% data variables.product.product_name %} sends out attached a `X-GitHub-Event`
HTTP header. We'll only care about the PR events for now. When a pull request is
merged (its state is `closed`, and `merged` is `true`), we'll kick off a deployment.

To test out this proof-of-concept, make some changes in a branch in your test
repository, open a pull request, and merge it. Your server should respond accordingly!

## Working with deployments

With our server in place, the code being reviewed, and our pull request
merged, we want our project to be deployed.

We'll start by modifying our event listener to process pull requests when they're
merged, and start paying attention to deployments:

``` ruby
when "pull_request"
  if @payload["action"] == "closed" && @payload["pull_request"]["merged"]
    start_deployment(@payload["pull_request"])
  end
when "deployment"
  process_deployment(@payload)
when "deployment_status"
  update_deployment_status
end
```

Based on the information from the pull request, we'll start by filling out the
`start_deployment` method:

``` ruby
def start_deployment(pull_request)
  user = pull_request['user']['login']
  payload = JSON.generate(:environment => 'production', :deploy_user => user)
  @client.create_deployment(pull_request['head']['repo']['full_name'], pull_request['head']['sha'], {:payload => payload, :description => "Deploying my sweet branch"})
end
```

Deployments can have some metadata attached to them, in the form of a `payload`
and a `description`. Although these values are optional, it's helpful to use
for logging and representing information.

When a new deployment is created, a completely separate event is triggered. That's
why we have a new `switch` case in the event handler for `deployment`. You can
use this information to be notified when a deployment has been triggered.

Deployments can take a rather long time, so we'll want to listen for various events,
such as when the deployment was created, and what state it's in.

Let's simulate a deployment that does some work, and notice the effect it has on
the output. First, let's complete our `process_deployment` method:

``` ruby
def process_deployment
  payload = JSON.parse(@payload['payload'])
  # you can send this information to your chat room, monitor, pager, etc.
  puts "Processing '#{@payload['description']}' for #{payload['deploy_user']} to #{payload['environment']}"
  sleep 2 # simulate work
  @client.create_deployment_status("repos/#{@payload['repository']['full_name']}/deployments/#{@payload['id']}", 'pending')
  sleep 2 # simulate work
  @client.create_deployment_status("repos/#{@payload['repository']['full_name']}/deployments/#{@payload['id']}", 'success')
end
```

Finally, we'll simulate storing the status information as console output:

``` ruby
def update_deployment_status
  puts "Deployment status for #{@payload['id']} is #{@payload['state']}"
end
```

Let's break down what's going on. A new deployment is created by `start_deployment`,
which triggers the `deployment` event. From there, we call `process_deployment`
to simulate work that's going on. During that processing, we also make a call to
`create_deployment_status`, which lets a receiver know what's going on, as we
switch the status to `pending`.

After the deployment is finished, we set the status to `success`.

## Conclusion

At GitHub, we've used a version of [Heaven][heaven] to manage
our deployments for years. A common flow is essentially the same as the
server we've built above:

* Wait for a response on the state of the CI checks (success or failure)
* If the required checks succeed, merge the pull request
* Heaven takes the merged code, and deploys it to staging and production servers
* In the meantime, Heaven also notifies everyone about the build, via [Hubot][hubot] sitting in our chat rooms

That's it! You don't need to build your own deployment setup to use this example.
You can always rely on [GitHub integrations][integrations].
