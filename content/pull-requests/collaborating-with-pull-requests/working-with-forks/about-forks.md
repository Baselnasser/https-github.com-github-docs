## About forks

Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository, also known as the "upstream" repository. After you fork a repository, you can fetch updates from the upstream repository to keep your fork up to date, and you can propose changes from your fork to the upstream repository with pull requests. A fork can be owned by either a personal account or an organization.

When you view a forked repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, the upstream repository is indicated below the name of the fork.

In open source projects, forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before incorporating the changes into the upstream repository. {% data reusables.repositories.about-giving-access-to-forks %}

Deleting a fork will not delete the original upstream repository. You can make any changes you want to your fork, and there will be no effect on the upstream. For example, you can add collaborators, rename files, or generate {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} on the fork without affecting the upstream. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %} After a fork is deleted, you cannot restore the fork. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/restoring-a-deleted-repository)."{% endif %} If you delete a private repository, all forks of the repository are deleted.

## Forking a repository versus duplicating a repository

If you want to create a new repository from the contents of an existing repository but don't want to merge your changes to the upstream in the future, you can duplicate the repository or, if the repository is a template, you can use the repository as a template. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)".

Forking a repository is similar to duplicating a repository, with the following differences.

* You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your fork to the upstream repository.
* You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your fork by synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository.
* Forks have their own members, branches, tags, labels, policies, issues, pull requests, discussions, actions, projects, and wikis.
* Forks inherit the restrictions of their upstream repositories. For example, branch protection rules cannot be passed down if the upstream repository belongs to an organization on a {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} plan.
