## Creating a branch
You can create a branch in different ways on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

{% note %}

**Note:** You can only create a branch in a repository to which you have push access.

{% endnote %}

{% ifversion create-branch-from-overview %}
### Creating a branch via the branches overview
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-branches %}
1. Click **New branch**.
   ![Screenshot of branches overview page with new branch button emphasized](/assets/images/help/branches/new-branch-button.png)
2. In the dialog box, enter the branch name and optionally change the branch source.  
   If the repository is a fork, you also have the option to select the upstream repository as the branch source.
   ![Screenshot of branch creation modal for a fork with branch source emphasized](/assets/images/help/branches/branch-creation-popup-branch-source.png)
3. Click **Create branch**.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.4 %}
### Creating a branch for an issue
You can create a branch to work on an issue directly from the issue page and get started right away. For more information, see "[Creating a branch to work on an issue](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue)".
{% endif %}

## Deleting a branch

{% data reusables.pull_requests.automatically-delete-branches %}

{% note %}

**Note:** If the branch you want to delete is the repository's default branch, you must choose a new default branch before deleting the branch. For more information, see "[Changing the default branch](/github/administering-a-repository/changing-the-default-branch)."

{% endnote %}

If the branch you want to delete is associated with an open pull request, you must merge or close the pull request before deleting the branch. For more information, see "[Merging a pull request](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)" or "[Closing a pull request](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/closing-a-pull-request)."

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-branches %}
1. Scroll to the branch that you want to delete, then click {% octicon "trash" aria-label="The trash icon to delete the branch" %}.
    ![delete the branch](/assets/images/help/branches/branches-delete.png) {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.5 or ghae-issue-6763 or ghec %}
1. If you try to delete a branch that is associated with at least one open pull request, you must confirm that you intend to close the pull request(s).
   
   ![Confirm deleting a branch](/assets/images/help/branches/confirm-deleting-branch.png){% endif %}

{% data reusables.pull_requests.retargeted-on-branch-deletion %}
