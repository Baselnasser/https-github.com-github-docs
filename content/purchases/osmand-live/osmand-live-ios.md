versions: '*'
---

The OsmAnd Live subscription for iOS has three periods: monthly, three months, yearly. This feature allows you to get unlimited download of all maps and get all the plug-ins for the subscription period. You also get the opportunity to frequently update maps.

To get this feature, go to the {% data reusables.purchases.get-osmand-live-ios %}. You can stop the subscription at any time using the settings in your itunes account.

Also, everyone who gets OsmAnd Live automatically supports the volunteers who edit the map as the money supporters provide get distributed between those who edit the map.
