The purchase system in iOS is a little different from that on Android. The Nautical maps and Contour lines are available for purchase while the Wikipedia plugin is free. The map downloads are available in bundles in case you do not need the maps of the entire world at the moment. For example, you can get the maps of Africa or Europe. Of course, free map downloads are available, as well. To view all the options, please visit the 'Maps & Resources' menu. {% data reusables.links.osmand-maps-app-store %}
