title: OsmAnd Beta Testing
versions: '*'
---

The Google Play Store offers to test beta versions of
apps, which enables you to (temporarily) download and use the test
version from the Google Play Store instead of the standard release
version(s).

For OsmAnd this means that you can participate in testing the new OsmAnd
free or the new OsmAnd+ paid versions. This enables you to use and test
exciting new features. Of course, using a beta version also means that
you might encounter bugs or app crashes.

The Google Play Store mechanism also supports the easy return to the
standard version from the Google Play Store.

## Activating the test version

Register as tester for the OsmAnd free test version via the following
Google Group: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.osmand Register
for the OsmAnd+ paid test version via the following Google Group:
[Testing](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.osmand.plus/testing)
(note: this is only possible if you are a registered user for the paid
version)
-   When you click the link to register, you will see a big blue or
    green panel advertising "Be a test user" (in your defined language).
-   After clicking the "button" you will see the message "You are now a
    tester" with a green check-mark in front of it (and on repetitive
    actions it will show "You are a tester").
-   Give Google some time to synchronize which can be anywhere between
    10 seconds or 60 minutes.
-   Now you can download the test version, either directly from the
    Google Play Store, or via your phone/tablet.

## Returning to the standard Google Play Store OsmAnd version

Note that the same registration screen, after having registered, also
has a link "Leave the test version". If, after some time, you want to
use the current standard release version from the Google Play Store
again, proceed as follows:
-   Use the above link again (so you better make this a
    bookmark/favorite in your browser). The page will still inform "You
    are a tester"
-   The page also contains the link "Leave the test version".
-   Click that link to then see "You have left the test version"
-   Manually uninstall the test version, either via the Google Play
    Store or on your phone/tablet.
-   Manually (re)install the current version, either via the Google Play
    Store or on your phone/tablet.

**Note**: Before changing to the test version, export your OsmAnd
favorites. The new test version should simply continue using the
favorites but as it is a beta version for testing, you never know.
