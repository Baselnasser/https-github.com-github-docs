title: Installing Different Builds
versions: '*'
---

Different builds of OsmAnd should install over any other build of the same strain (older or newer) without any issues, and with all offline data being preserved.
The latest development build (*not necessarily stable !*) for testing can be found [here](https://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAnd-default.apk).
This will usually update over any other development build of the same development generation. Should trying to update produce a signing or "not installed" error (like if you currently use the market, or want to downgrade to a much older dev build), please
- export your Favorites first (Menu/Export in the fav list)
- export your Navigation profiles
- uninstall the previous version
- re-install the new development build
- re-import your Favorites again (Menu/Import)
All maps/tracks etc. are kept in place unchanged during this procedure.
