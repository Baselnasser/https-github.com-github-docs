# What languages will be included in OsmAnd ?

> Dear translators,
> 
> Thank you all very much for your efforts to complete our display language translations, and also to localize OsmAnd in more and more languages on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/osmand/)!
> 
> Please note the following: I am happy to include in OsmAnd's display language selection menu any new language with >10% translation rate, (will mark it as "incomplete" until it reaches ~80%). Please post an issue with OsmAnd if you need this done, I only sporadically watch these figures on Weblate.
> 
> Unfortunately, languages featuring 3-letter ISO 639-2 codes currently seem to have issues in Android, see e.g.*   [https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=49120](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=49120)*   [https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=106574](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=106574)  
>     This means that, unfortunately, any such language may not display in the OsmAnd menus on your device. (This issue only affects the language used in the app menus, not in the map, of course.)
