To attach a file to an issue or pull request conversation, drag and drop it into the comment box. Alternatively, you can click the bar at the bottom of the comment box to browse, select, and add a file from your computer.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes or ghae-issue-7575 %}{% note %}

**Note:** Video codec compatibility is browser specific, and it's possible that a video you upload to one browser is not viewable on another browser. At the moment we recommend using h.264 for greatest compatibility.
