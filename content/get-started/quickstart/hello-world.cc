HIGH SPEED (8000 FRAMES/SEC.) MOTION PICTURE CAMERA New "Fas tax" employs 8-mm and 16-mm film driven at speeds up to 70 mph or 8000 fps. It employs continuous film drive, as distinguished from the stop-exposeadvance cycle of professional and amateur slow-motion cameras. Exposure of successive frames is accomplished by a revolving prism acting as an optical compensator whereby images travel in synchronism with film past film gate during exposure period. Object under study is illuminated by a continuous concentrated light of high-intensity lamp filaments, not by intermittently flashing gaseous discharge lamps as in the use of stroboscopic cameras. This enables the "Fastax" to photograph self-luminous objects such as fusing lamp filaments, or to make high-speed analyses of polarized light. Wide choice of light sources permits the use of many film types including color film up to 1,000 fps.

NEW LENS CEMENT The Army requires that camera lenses, especially those of aerial cameras, be able to withstand desert temperatures of more than 100° and high altitude temperatures of from -50° to -60°. Investigation showed that the cement binding the various elements of the lenses was responsible for lens destruction and discoloration.
As a result of two years research, Eastman Kodak Co. has developed a new type of lens cement so much more effective than that made from Canada Balsam, that the Army Air Forces have changed lens specifications accordingly. All lens manufacturers are now being instructed in the technique of using this new cement.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY X-RAYS
RH Cooke, 1.S.R. X-rays are destined to play an increasingly important part in the quest for perfection. Many plastic moldings and materials used in electrical and aircraft work incorporate a wide variety of metal inserts, conductors, etc., which require extreme precision. In the majority of cases these inserts are not visible from the surface. Consequently, only by X-ray method can information be obtained as to their location or condition. When permanent record is required, it is necessary that a radiograph be taken which is perhaps the most obvious method of X-ray inspection and one which can be readily adapted to work with existing test procedure. By use of the radiograph method much fuller investigation of plas tics. can be undertaken; the examination of molding for macroscopic flaws and foreign inclusions, the study of homogeneity and the determination of curing times being a few of the possible applications. .Plastics Oct '43 PP 438- 445 11 illus

THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE: ITS APPLICATIONS IN METALLURGY
VK Zworyk in
The fact that electrons are affected by magnetic and electric fields with axial symmetry, just as light is affected by glass lenses, has permitted the development of the electron microscope which is able to resolve detail about 100 times as fine as the light microscope. The usefulness of this microscope has been increased by the compactness, ease of operation and certainty of results of the newer models.
This article describes in detail the RCA electron microscope, which occupies only 5 sq ft of floor space and is about 9 ft high. A cabinet in the rear accommodates the transforming, rectifying and stabilizing equipment for providing high voltage current. All electrical controls are mounted on a panel behind the microscope and the observer may reach them from a seated position.

## Introduction

{% data variables.product.product_name %} is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you {% data variables.product.product_name %} essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

In this quickstart guide, you will:

* Create and use a repository
* Start and manage a new branch
* Make changes to a file and push them to {% data variables.product.product_name %} as commits
* Open and merge a pull request

To complete this tutorial, you need a [{% data variables.product.product_name %} account](http://github.com) and Internet access. You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that {% data variables.product.product_name %} is built on).

## Creating a repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a `README` file, a file with information about your project. {% data variables.product.product_name %} makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

Your `hello-world` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

{% data reusables.repositories.create_new %}
1. In the **Repository name** box, enter `hello-world`.
2. In the **Description** box, write a short description.
3. Select **Add a README file**.
4. Click **Create repository**.

   ![Create a hello world repository](/assets/images/help/repository/hello-world-repo.png)

## Creating a branch

Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.

By default, your repository has one branch named `main` that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `main`.

When you create a branch off the `main` branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of `main` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `main` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:

* The `main` branch
* A new branch called `feature`
* The journey that `feature` takes before it's merged into `main`

![branching diagram](/assets/images/help/repository/branching.png)

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:

* `story.txt`
* `story-joe-edit.txt`
* `story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt`

Branches accomplish similar goals in {% data variables.product.product_name %} repositories.

Here at {% data variables.product.product_name %}, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our `main` (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into `main`.

### Create a branch

1. Click the **Code** tab of your `hello-world` repository.
2. Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says **main**.
   ![Branch menu](/assets/images/help/branch/branch-selection-dropdown.png)
4. Type a branch name, `readme-edits`, into the text box.
5. Click **Create branch: readme-edits from main**.

![Branch menu](/assets/images/help/repository/new-branch.png)

Now you have two branches, `main` and `readme-edits`. Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new branch.

## Making and committing changes

When you created a new branch in the previous step, {% data variables.product.product_name %} brought you to the code page for your new `readme-edits` branch, which is a copy of `main`.

You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On {% data variables.product.product_name %}, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

1. Click the `README.md` file.
1. Click {% octicon "pencil" aria-label="The edit icon" %} to edit the file.
3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4. In the **Commit changes** box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
5. Click **Commit changes**.

   ![Commit example](/assets/images/help/repository/first-commit.png)

These changes will be made only to the README file on your `readme-edits` branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from `main`.

## Opening a pull request

Now that you have changes in a branch off of `main`, you can open a pull request.

Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s `@mention` feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It's a great way to learn the {% data variables.product.product_name %} flow before working on larger projects.

1. Click the **Pull requests** tab of your `hello-world` repository.
2. Click **New pull request**
3. In the **Example Comparisons** box, select the branch you made, `readme-edits`, to compare with `main` (the original).
4. Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.

   ![diff example](/assets/images/help/repository/diffs.png)

5. Click **Create pull request**.
6. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.
7. Click **Create pull request**.

Your collaborators can now review your edits and make suggestions.

## Merging your pull request

In this final step, you will merge your `readme-edits` branch into the `main` branch.

1. Click **Merge pull request** to merge the changes into `main`.
2. Click **Confirm merge**.
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, by clicking **Delete branch**.

## Next steps

By completing this tutorial, you've learned to create a project and make a pull request on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

Here's what you accomplished in this tutorial:

* Created an open source repository
* Started and managed a new branch
* Changed a file and committed those changes to {% data variables.product.product_name %}
* Opened and merged a pull request

Take a look at your {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile and you'll see your work reflected on your contribution graph.

For more information about the power of branches and pull requests, see "[GitHub flow](/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)." For more information about getting started with {% data variables.product.product_name %}, see the other guides in the [getting started quickstart](/get-started/quickstart).

By use of the radiograph method much fuller investigation of plas tics. can be undertaken; the examination of molding for macroscopic flaws and foreign inclusions, the study of homogeneity and the determination of curing times being a few of the possible applications. .Plastics Oct '43 PP 438- 445 11 illus

THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE: ITS APPLICATIONS IN METALLURGY
VK Zworyk in
The fact that electrons are affected by magnetic and electric fields with axial symmetry, just as light is affected by glass lenses, has permitted the development of the electron microscope which is able to resolve detail about 100 times as fine as the light microscope. The usefulness of this microscope has been increased by the compactness, ease of operation and certainty of results of the newer models.
This article describes in detail the RCA electron microscope, which occupies only 5 sq ft of floor space and is about 9 ft high. A cabinet in the rear accommodates the transforming, rectifying and stabilizing equipment for providing high voltage current. All electrical controls are mounted on a panel behind the microscope and the observer may reach them from a seated position.

HIGH SPEED (8000 FRAMES/SEC.) MOTION PICTURE CAMERA New "Fas tax" employs 8-mm and 16-mm film driven at speeds up to 70 mph or 8000 fps. It employs continuous film drive, as distinguished from the stop-exposeadvance cycle of professional and amateur slow-motion cameras. Exposure of successive frames is accomplished by a revolving prism acting as an optical compensator whereby images travel in synchronism with film past film gate during exposure period. Object under study is illuminated by a continuous concentrated light of high-intensity lamp filaments, not by intermittently flashing gaseous discharge lamps as in the use of stroboscopic cameras. This enables the "Fastax" to photograph self-luminous objects such as fusing lamp filaments, or to make high-speed analyses of polarized light. Wide choice of light sources permits the use of many film types including color film up to 1,000 fps.

NEW LENS CEMENT The Army requires that camera lenses, especially those of aerial cameras, be able to withstand desert temperatures of more than 100° and high altitude temperatures of from -50° to -60°. Investigation showed that the cement binding the various elements of the lenses was responsible for lens destruction and discoloration.
As a result of two years research, Eastman Kodak Co. has developed a new type of lens cement so much more effective than that made from Canada Balsam, that the Army Air Forces have changed lens specifications accordingly. All lens manufacturers are now being instructed in the technique of using this new cement.

ADJUSTABLE DIAMETER GAGE New "Model 236 B-123" designed to check simultaneously various diameters of a rotor shaft, is adjustable to take any length of shaft up to 12 in and can be furnished with gauging units to accommodate any diameter up to 4 in. The shaft is mounted between centers so that it can be rotated, permitting all its diameters to be checked easily. Gauging units and brackets housing the centers are designed to slide in T-slots in the base, can be moved longitudinally and locked in any position by a T-bolt. Diameters an yw here along length of shaft can be checked. Each gauging unit consisting of a dial indicator, a sensitive contact and a fixed contact, is mounted on stiff springs and is free to move transversely so that it can adjust itself to diameter of workpiece. Movement of sensitive contact is transferred directly to indicator point by a pantograph unit. This permits many positions to be checked, also provides a convenient means for adjusting the contacts to a master. The fixed contact also can be adjusted if necessary. - Instruments Oct '43

REGENERATIVE DYNAMOMETERS Descriptions of a means of utilizing power developed on aircraft engine test beds. of the AC regenerative type, the dynamometer consists essentially of a constant-speed alternator coupled to the engine by an eddy current magnetic coupling, slip being automatically controlled by electric means. At low speeds the alternator rotor is held stationary by a friction brake, the coupling in these conditions working at 100% slip, thus absorbing the full power output of the engine.
The British havę modified the American version by providing each test bed with a torque-weighing mechanism, the actual bhp developed by each separate engine is placed beyond doubt, and the tester's task is eased by the immediate indication of any change in engine output from overheating, tuning adjustments, etc. - Aircraft Production Nov '43

NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING BY X-RAYS
RH Cooke, 1.S.R. X-rays are destined to play an increasingly important part in the quest for perfection. Many plastic moldings and materials used in electrical and aircraft work incorporate a wide variety of metal inserts, conductors, etc., which require extreme precision. In the majority of cases these inserts are not visible from the surface. Consequently, only by X-ray method can information be obtained as to their location or condition. When permanent record is required, it is necessary that a radiograph be taken which is perhaps the most obvious method of X-ray inspection and one which can be readily adapted to work with existing test procedure. By use of the radiograph method much fuller investigation of plas tics. can be undertaken; the examination of molding for macroscopic flaws and foreign inclusions, the study of homogeneity and the determination of curing times being a few of the possible applications. .Plastics Oct '43 PP 438- 445 11 illus
