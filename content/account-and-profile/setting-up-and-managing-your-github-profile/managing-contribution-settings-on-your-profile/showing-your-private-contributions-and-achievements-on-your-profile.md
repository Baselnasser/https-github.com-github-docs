If you publicize your private contributions, people without access to the private repositories you work in won't be able to see the details of your private contributions. Instead, they'll see the number of private contributions you made on any given day. Your public contributions will include detailed information. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile)."

## Changing the visibility of your private contributions

You can choose to publicize your private contributions, which allows visitors to your profile to see private contribution counts, without further details.

If you choose to hide your private contributions, visitors will only see your public contributions.

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}
1. Under "Contributions & Activity", select or deselect **Include private contributions on my profile**.


## Changing the visibility of achievements

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. Under "Profile settings", select or deselect **Show Achievements on my profile.**
1. Click **Update preferences**.

{% ifversion hide-individual-achievements %}

## Hiding an individual achievement on your profile

You can hide an individual achievement on your profile. When hidden, badges are only visible to you.

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}
1. Under "Achievements", click the achievement you want to hide.
