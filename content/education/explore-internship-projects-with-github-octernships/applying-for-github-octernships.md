To apply for internships, you must meet the following requirements:

* You have been accepted to {% data variables.product.prodname_global_campus %}. For more information, including how to apply, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-students/apply-to-github-global-campus-as-a-student)."

You can find and apply for internships at [education.github.com/students/octernships](https://education.github.com/students/octernships). You can apply for up to four internships at any one time.

Each internship project has an assignment to complete. The assignment consists of a problem statement, videos, and other content. When you apply for a project, you can then complete the assignment and submit your work in the repository created for you.

You may then be invited to a remote interview and following the interview, the partner organization can decide whether to offer the internship project to you. If successful, you will receive an email notification and will be able to accept or decline the project on your [{% data variables.product.prodname_octernships %} dashboard](https://education.github.com/globalcampus/octernships).

If you choose to accept an internship project, you will be asked to submit your Discord username so the {% data variables.product.prodname_education %} team can invite you to a Discord server to communicate with partner organizations, the {% data variables.product.prodname_education %}, and other students.
