## About migration support for {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} can migrate to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} from any of our supported migration sources. The data included in each migration depends on the source.

{% data reusables.enterprise-migration-tool.supported-migration-paths %}

During the beta, there are known limitations for the {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_secondary_name %} that apply to all sources.

## Azure DevOps migration support

If your migration source is Azure DevOps, you can migrate repositories.

You can only use {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} to migrate from Azure DevOps Cloud, not from Azure DevOps Server. If you currently use Azure DevOps Server and want to migrate to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you can migrate to Azure DevOps Cloud first. For more information, see [Migrate to Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/migrate/) on the Azure site.

We currently only support migrating the following repository data from Azure DevOps to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}.

  - Git source (including commit history)
  - Pull requests
  - User history for pull requests
  - Work item links on pull requests
  - Attachments on pull requests
  - Branch protections for the repository (user-scoped branch protections not included)

If you want to migrate Azure Pipelines to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, contact your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account manager.

## Bitbucket Server migration support

{% data reusables.enterprise-migration-tool.bbs-release-phase %}

Migrations from Bitbucket Server are only supported for Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center version 5.14+ or higher.

If your migration source is Bitbucket Server, you can migrate repositories. We currently only support migrating the following repository data from Bitbucket Server to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}.

- Git source (including commit history)
- Pull requests (including pull request reviews, required reviewers, comments and attachments)

Currently, the following data is **not** migrated.

- Branch permissions
- Commit comments
- Repository settings

{% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} does not migrate CI pipelines from Bitbucket Server.

## {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} migration support

If your migration source is {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, you can migrate individual repositories or entire organizations.

When you migrate an organization, a new organization is created within the destination enterprise account. Then, the following data is migrated to the new organization.

- Teams
- Repositories
- Team access to repositories
- Member privileges
- Organization-level webhooks
- Default branch name for new repositories created in the organization

All repositories are migrated with private visibility. If you want to set a repository's visibility to public or internal, you can do this after the migration using the UI or API.

Team membership is **not** migrated. After the migration, you'll need to add members to migrated teams. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/understanding-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-between-github-products-with-github-enterprise-importer#recreating-teams)."

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data reusables.enterprise-migration-tool.team-references %} For more information about how to prevent and resolve these issues, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/troubleshooting-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer#team-references-are-broken-after-an-organization-migration)."

{% endnote %}

When you migrate a repository, either directly or as part of an organization migration, only the following data is migrated.

  - Git source (including commit history)
  - Pull requests
  - Issues
  - Milestones
  - Wikis
  - Projects (classic) at the repository level
  - {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows
  - Commit comments
  - Active webhooks
  - Repository topics
  - Repository settings
     - Branch protections (see ["Branch protections"](#branch-protections) for more details)
     - {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} settings
     - Autolink references
     - {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} settings
     - Pull request settings
       - Automatically delete head branches
       - Allow auto-merge
       - Allow merge commits (commit message setting is reset to the default message)
       - Allow squash merging (commit message setting is reset to the default message)
       - Allow rebase merging
  - Releases (up to 10 GB per repository)
  - User history for the above data

{% data reusables.enterprise-migration-tool.data-not-migrated %}
- User access to the repository

When you migrate a repository directly, teams and team access to repositories are not migrated.

### Branch protections

Branch protections apply a specified set of rules to a specific branch name or branch name pattern. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)."

Branch protections will always be migrated, but certain rules will not be migrated. The following branch protection rules are not migrated.

- Allow specific actors to bypass required pull requests
- Require approval of the most recent push
- Require deployments to succeed before merging
- Lock branch
- Restrict pushes that create matching branches
- Allow force pushes

The following limitations also apply:

- If a branch protection rule optionally allows you to specify people, teams, or apps that are exempt from the rule, such as "Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews," the exceptions will not be migrated.
- If the "Allow force pushes" rule is enabled in "Specify who can force push" mode, the rule will not be migrated.

## {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} migration support

If your migration source is {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, you can migrate repositories.

To migrate from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} (GHES), you must have GHES version 3.4.1 or higher.

Item | GHES 3.4.1+ | GHES 3.5.0+ |
---- | ---------- | ---------- |
Git source (including commit history) | **X** | **X** |
Pull requests | **X** | **X** |
Issues | **X** | **X** |
Milestones | **X** | **X** |
Wikis | **X** | **X** |
Projects (classic) at the repository level | **X** | **X** |
{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows | **X** | **X** |
Commit comments | **X** | **X** |
Active webhooks | **X** | **X** |
Branch protections | **X** | **X** |
{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} settings | **X** | **X** |

Different size limits per repository apply depending on your GHES version.

Limit | GHES <3.8.0 | GHES 3.8.0+ |
----- | ----------- | ----------- |
Git source | 2GB | 10GB
Metadata | 2GB | 10GB

{% data reusables.enterprise-migration-tool.data-not-migrated %}
- Teams
- User or team access to the repository
- Repository settings for pull requests

## Limitations

There are limits to what {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} can migrate. Some are due to limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, while others are limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} itself.

### Limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}

- **2 GB size limit for a single Git commit:** No single commit in your Git repository can be larger than 2 GB. If any of your commits are larger than 2 GB, you will need to split the commit into smaller commits that are each 2 GB or smaller.
- **255 byte limit for Git references:** No single [Git reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References), commonly known as a "ref", can have a name larger than 255 bytes. Usually, this means that your references cannot be more than 255 characters long, but any non-[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters, such as emojis, may consume more than one byte. If any of your Git references are too large, we'll return a clear error message.
- **100 MB file size limit:** No single file in your Git repository can be larger than 100 MB. Consider using {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} for storing large files. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files)."

### Limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %}

- **10 GB size limit for a Git repository:** This limit only applies to the source code. To inspect the size of your repository, use the [git-sizer](https://github.com/github/git-sizer) tool and check the total size of blobs.
- **10 GB limit for metadata**: The {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_secondary_name %} cannot migrate repositories with more than 10 GB of metadata. Metadata includes issues, pull requests, releases, and attachments. In most cases, large metadata is caused by binary assets attached to releases. You can exclude releases from the migration with the `migrate-repo` command's `--skip-releases` flag, and then move your releases manually after the migration.
- **{% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects not migrated**: The {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_secondary_name %} can migrate repositories that use {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}, but the LFS objects themselves will not be migrated. They can be pushed to your migration destination as a follow-up task after the migration is complete. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository-that-contains-git-large-file-storage-objects)."
- **Follow-up tasks required:** When migrating between {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} products, certain settings are not migrated and must be reconfigured in the new repository. For a list of follow-up tasks you'll need to complete after each migration, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/understanding-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-between-github-products-with-github-enterprise-importer#completing-follow-up-tasks)."
- **Delayed code search functionality:** Re-indexing the search index can take a few hours after a repository is migrated, and code searches may return unexpected results until re-indexing is complete.
