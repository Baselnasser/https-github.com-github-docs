## About migration logs

Each time you run a migration with {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %}, a migration log is created. The migration log lists the steps that were completed as part of the migration and includes additional information.

- Who ran the migration
- The source of the migration
- How long the migration took
- Any resources that didn't migrate as expected

You can access the migration log for a repository migration in multiple ways.

- On {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, by viewing the "Migration Log" issue in the migrated repository. You can use this issue to discuss any warnings with your team and record any decisions.
- By downloading a log file using the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}.

When you run an organization migration, {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} additionally creates a repository named `gei-migration-results` in the destination organization. This repository contains information about the migration of organization-level data and duplicates the information in the "Migration Log" issues for each migrated repository.

For more information about interpreting error messages in your migration log, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/troubleshooting-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer#troubleshooting-successful-migrations)."

## Viewing a repository migration log on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}

People with read access to a repository can access the migration log for the repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

1. Navigate to the migrated repository in your destination organization.
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-issues %}
1. Click the issue with the title "Migration Log."

## Downloading a repository migration log with the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}

Organization owners and people with the migrator role can download migration logs using the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. For more information about the migrator role, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/preparing-to-migrate-with-github-enterprise-importer/granting-the-migrator-role-for-github-enterprise-importer)."

You can download the latest migration log for an individual repository with the `download-logs` command. The exact command depends on your migration source.

```shell{:copy}
gh ado2gh download-logs --github-target-org DESTINATION --target-repo REPOSITORY --migration-log-file FILENAME
```

{% data reusables.enterprise-migration-tool.add-pat-to-download-logs %}

### Downloading all the repository migration logs for a migration script

To ensure you have access to migration logs for all your migrated repositories, you can use the `--download-migration-logs` flag when generating a migration script for repository migrations. When you use this flag, the script will include the `download-logs` command for each repository migrated in the script. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-repositories-with-github-enterprise-importer)."

{% note %}

**Note:** You can only use the `--download-migration-logs` flag with repository migrations, not with organization migrations.

{% endnote %}

## Accessing an organization migration log

Owners of the destination organization can access the migration log for an organization migration on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

To access the migration log for an organization migration, navigate to the repository named `gei-migration-results` in your destination organization.

The `README.md` file in the root of the repository includes the following information about the organization migration:
- Any warnings or errors related to the migration of organization-level data, such as settings and teams
- The number of repositories that were successfully migrated and the number of repositories that failed to migrate

The`/success` and `/failure` directories contain one file for each repository that was successfully migrated or that failed to migrate, respectively. These files follow the naming convention `REPO_NAME.md`.

{% note %}

**Note:** The `gei-migration-results` repository is created at the beginning of the migration process but is only updated with your migration logs after the migration finishes.
