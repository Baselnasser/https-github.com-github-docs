Now that you've [configured your local server](/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/configuring-your-server-to-receive-payloads), you might
be interested in pushing your code to the limits. To that end, GitHub's webhooks
view provides some tooling for testing your deployed payloads.

## Listing recent deliveries

Every webhook has its own "Recent Deliveries" section, which lists, at a glance whether a delivery was successful (green check) or failed (red x). You can also identify when each delivery was attempted.

{% data variables.product.product_name %} keeps a log of each webhook delivery for {% ifversion fpt or ghec %} 30 {% else %} 8 {% endif %} days.

## Digging into results

By expanding an individual delivery, you'll be able to witness *precisely*
what information GitHub is attempting to send to your server. This includes
both the HTTP Request and Response.

### Request

The webhook delivery view provides information on which Headers were sent by GitHub.
It also includes details about the JSON payload.

### Response

The response tab lists how your server replied once it received the payload from
GitHub. This includes the status code, the headers, and any additional data
within the response body.
