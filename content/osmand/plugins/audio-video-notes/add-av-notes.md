You can use this plugin while  [recording the GPX track](https://osmand.net/features/trip-recording-plugin). This way, all your notes will be added to the track as waypoints automatically. When viewing the track, you'll see exactly what was recorded where.

To view everything later, you can export the track together with all the media and see them in the  [JOSM editor](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/). Please note that you'll need to put the media in the corresponding folder (you'll know which one if you click on a video note and see the message about a missing file. Just put it in the indicated folder).

So there you have it: your personal notes linked to the map and stored in one place. Document your adventures!
