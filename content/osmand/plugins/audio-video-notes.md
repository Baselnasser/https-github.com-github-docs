# Add notes to your GPX track

You can use this plugin while  [recording the GPX track](https://osmand.net/features/trip-recording-plugin). This way, all your notes will be added to the track as waypoints automatically. When viewing the track, you'll see exactly what was recorded where.

![Audio_video_notes](/assets/images/plugins/audio-video-notes/av-5.png)
To view everything later, you can export the track together with all the media and see them in the  [JOSM editor](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/). Please note that you'll need to put the media in the corresponding folder (you'll know which one if you click on a video note and see the message about a missing file. Just put it in the indicated folder).
