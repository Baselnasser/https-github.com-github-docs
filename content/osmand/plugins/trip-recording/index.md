<!-- OsmAnd Trip recording plugin is an essential tool for runners, sportsmen and tourists. It allows you to record your movement using your phone's GPS (and through other networks optionally). If you are going for a run, need to see your entire route after a walk around the city or measure the distance you covered, the plugin will help you.

{% data variables.product.ios_button_seq %} {% data variables.ios-values.menu %} → {% data variables.ios-values.res_mapsres %} → tab {% data variables.ios-values.plugins %} → {% data variables.ios-values.product_title_track_recording %} → tick the button

> **_Note:_** [Trip recording (REC) widget](https://docs.osmand.net/en/main@latest/osmand/widgets/action-widgets#trip-recording-rec-widget) is required to use Trip recording feature.

## Trip recording Plugin settings for Android

To configure settings follow {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.plugins_menu_group: %} → tap the Trip recording plugin

![REC Settings Plugin](/assets/images/docs/widgets/rec_settings_plugin.png)

### Configure trip recording profile

Default 'Trip recording' profile is Browse map profile. User can choose other OsmAnd profile or create his own (Manage<!--сделать ссылку на инстукцию как сделать уникальный профиль [Manage profile ](text)-->) profile.

![REC profile](/assets/images/docs/widgets/rec_plugin_change_profile.png)

To change the profile please click the globe icon in the upper-right corner.

### Configure trip recording navigation

![REC navigation](/assets/images/docs/widgets/rec_plugin_navigation.png)

Auto-record track during navigation – the function that enables saving each 'trip recording' track automatically. <br>
User may find his track under {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_my_places %} → {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_gpx_files %} tab

> :warning: **Track recording impacts the battery life**. Even if the screen is off, it continues to run. Check the notifications in the background in status bar!

Logging interval during navigation controls the frequency of queries to the GPS sensor along with the frequency of new dots appearing in the track line. <br>
By default, it is set to 5 seconds, but it can be configured in the range from 0 seconds to 5 minutes.

### Configure trip recording logging accuracy

![REC logging accuracy](/assets/images/docs/widgets/rec_plugin_logging_accuracy.png)

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| General logging interval |Specifies the logging interval for the general track recording. Can be set to 'always ask' or optionally chosen in the range between 0 to 5 minutes. Can be turned on via [Trip recording (REC) widget](https://docs.osmand.net/en/main@latest/osmand/widgets/action-widgets#trip-recording-rec-widget). |
| Minimum displacement | Specifies the minimum displacement for the track recording. Can be chosen as 'not selected' or optionally chosen from 2 meters  to 50 meters.  This function should be configured to avoid duplicating points being recorded where too little actual motion may have occurred. |
| Minimum accuracy | Accuracy means the proximity of  measurements to the actual position. It is not directly related to precision, which is the spread of repeated measurements. Lowering the accuracy range value may reduce the amount of points recorded depending on GPS signal quality. |
| Minimum speed | Used to filter out the points while object is not moving or moving with a low speed. By using this option User may eliminate recording the bunch of points during the stop time and make resulting track look smoother on the map. |
| Auto-split recording after gap | When enabled, enforces new segment start after 6 minutes gap, new track start after 2 hours gap, new file start when date changed. |
| Prevent standalone logging | When enabled - disables track recording when the app is stopped. In this case, the OsmAnd background indication will disappear from the Android's notification bar.  |
| Include heading | Enables saving of the heading to each track point recorded. |   


> **_TIP:_**
> Set 5 meters distance for 'Minimum displacement' function if there is no need to capture precise data while not moving.

> **_TIP:_**
> It is hard to predict the set of data that will be recorded. If the user is not sure about GPS signal quality it makes sense to turn off (not select) the 'Minimum accuracy' filter.

> **_TIP:_**
> Try to disable 'Minimum displacement' first (set to 'Not selected'). It will help you not to lose data.  If the resulting track looks noisy, try non zero value for this parameter and also raise 'Minimum speed'.

### Configure trip informational settings

![REC informational settings](/assets/images/docs/widgets/rec_plugin_info_settings.png)

**Track storage folder**

Is used to define where the tracks will be stored. There are two options:

- Record tracks to 'rec' folder
- Store recorded tracks in monthly folder

> **_Note:_** User can find his tracks in {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_my_places   %} → {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_gpx_files %} tab.

**Notification**

Displays system notification allowing to start trip recording.

**Online tracking**

Allows sharing current location using trip recording.

- Web address <!-- не понятно зачем-->
- Tracking interval - Allows user to specify online tracking interval from 0 seconds to 5 minutes.
- Time buffer - Allows user to specify a time buffer that will keep locations for certain period of time when Internet connection lost.

**Configure trip general settings**

![REC general settings](/assets/images/docs/widgets/rec_plugin_general_settings.png)

- The track folder will redirect user to {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_gpx_files %} tab in {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_my_places  %}
- 'Reset plugin settings to default'  - resets all plugin settings to default values. All user settings for this plugin will be lost!
- 'Copy from another profile' - copies plugin settings from another profile.
