This plugin gives the terrain information you can view over the basic map. It actually works several ways â€” as a terrain contour lines data provider and as a full hillshade map using dark shades and colors to show slopes, peaks and lowlands.

The global data (between 70 degrees north and 70 degrees south) is based on measurements by SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) and ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), an imaging instrument onboard Terra, the flagship satellite of NASA's Earth Observing System. ASTER is a cooperative effort between NASA, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems).

Contour lines plugin is a handy tool for hikers, tourists and anyone who needs the information about the terrain in a specific area.
