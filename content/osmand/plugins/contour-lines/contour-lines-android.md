For using this feature you should buy  [Contour lines plugin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.srtmPlugin.paid&hl=en)  or subscribe  [OsmAnd live](https://osmand.net/features/subscription). Remember: Switch on the  _Contour lines Plugin_  in  _Plugin_  menu.

To see the contours of a specific area, just go to  _Download maps_  menu, find your country or region, choose Contour lines, Hillshades, Slopes or all and download the files. Then zoom your desired area until you see the lines and zoom even more to check the height of a specific spot (the number on the line). To view hillshade or slope, make sure you enable this option in  _Configure map - Terrain_  menu. Also, please note that while contour lines file can be split by regions, hillshade/slopes files can be available by country, thus, you'll see the Hillshade/Slopes download on the list of downloads of a country, not on the region maps page.

In the  _Terrain_  menu you can change Hillshade or Slope for the visible layer. Here you can set Transparency and Zoom levels for the layer. To do so, please go to  _Configure map - Terrain_.

For Contour lines you can set the minimal zoom level where the contour lines will become visible, color scheme, width and density for lines. To do so, please go to  _Configure map - Show contour lines (settings)_.

You can use both contour lines and terrain together to get the information from both layers. Just go to  _Configure map_  menu and enable both  _Contour lines_  and  _Terrain layer_  options. If you cannot see the hillshade/slopes after downloading it, please restart the application.

After that, you'll be able to enjoy a map with all the hills and peaks. A nice option for both practical use and a general knowledge about the area you live in or travel to.
