For using this feature you should buy  [Contour lines in-app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osmand-maps-travel-navigate/id934850257)  or subscribe  [OsmAnd live](https://osmand.net/features/subscription#osm_live_ios). To turn the contour lines on in iOS, you need to go to  _'Maps & Resources'_  menu, switch to the  _Plugins_  tab and turn the  _Contour lines_  plugin on. Then download the Contour lines map of the area you need. You'll also have to download the Hillshade/Slope map if you need it. All downloads are available in  _'Maps and Resources' - 'Maps'_  menu. Also, you have to go to the  _Map_  menu in the left upper corner of the map screen and turn the  _Terrain_  option on. That's it. You are now viewing the maps with contour line information and hillshade/slope.
