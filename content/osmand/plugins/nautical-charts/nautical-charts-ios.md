At first you just have to enable Nautical plugin: _app menu-> Maps & Resources-> Plugins-> Nautical map_. There, you'll have to buy the plugin by tapping on the checkbox.

You also will need a World seamarks map. Make sure to get it in _app menu-> Maps & Resources-> Nautical maps_. Please note that OsmAnd Nautical Charts work best with the World seamarks map and we recommend to download it. Then go to _app menu-> Map-> Details-> enable the 'Nautical depth contours' option_.

Next turn the Nautical map style on using the Map menu in the left upper corner of the screen or _app menu-> Map-> Map type-> Nautical_.
