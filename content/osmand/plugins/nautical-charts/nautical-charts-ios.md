At first you just have to enable Nautical plugin: app menu-> Maps & Resources-> Plugins-> Nautical map. There, you'll have to buy the plugin by tapping on the checkbox.

You also will need a World seamarks map. Make sure to get it in app menu-> Maps & Resources-> Nautical maps. Please note that OsmAnd Nautical Charts work best with the World seamarks map and we recommend to download it. Then go to app menu-> Map-> Details-> enable the 'Nautical depth contours' option.

Next turn the Nautical map style on using the Map menu in the left upper corner of the screen or app menu-> Map-> Map type-> Nautical.
