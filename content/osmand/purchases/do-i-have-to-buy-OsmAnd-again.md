I uninstalled the app/I'm using a new device. Do I have to buy OsmAnd again?

## Android

-   No. Just enter Google Play using the same account you used to buy
    OsmAnd, then find OsmAnd through Search and install it again.

## iOS

-   No. All you have to do is enter the Appstore and install OsmAnd
    again. You can use it on as many devices as you want without the
    need to buy the app again. You may see the "Buy" button, but you
    won't have to pay: just press it to download the app without paying
    again.
