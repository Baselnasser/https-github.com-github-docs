-   **Camera/voice recording** - this is only used by [the Audio/Video notes plugin (for Android version only)](https://osmand.net/features/audio-video-notes-plugin). This feature is optional and by default disabled (it can be enabled in the Plugin Manager). It allows to quickly create location-related audio/video notes during a trip.

-   **Billing permission** - even though the free application doesn't have any in app purchases, it was introduced to get them in and the last moment inapp was excluded. There is no reason to remove that in app because it will be needed to go through long procedure of extending permissions again.
