title: OsmAnd+ installation on the SD card fails
versions: '*'
---

(for Android version only)

This happens only for the OsmAnd+ paid version and it is a known Google
Play issue (this is reproducible for other paid applications copied to
SD card).

Symptoms: Application was installed on SD card and update fails

Possible solution:

-   Check here
    http://www.newbiehelper.net/solve-couldnt-install-on-usb-storage-or-sd-card-error-in-android-2-2/
-   If you have a running application, please make a backup
-   Export your favorites and then uninstall the application completely
-   Clear the cache of Google Play app and unmount the SD card
-   Re-install the app

Because this issue happens before the OsmAnd app even starts, this issue
cannot be fixed in OsmAnd, but needs to be fixed by Google Play. Please
turn to Google Play — Help — Contact Us and report the issue there so
Google can fix it. (The issue happens only for some devices and Android
versions.)
