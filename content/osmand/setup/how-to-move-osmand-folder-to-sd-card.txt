(for Android version only)

In order to move the OsmAnd home (maps) folder to an external SD card:

-   Go to Settings (on the start screen)-\> OsmAnd Settings-\> [Data
    storage folder (for Android version
    only)](https://osmand.net/features/start#Setting_OsmAnd_for_your_region_android).
-   Change the value to a path pointing to the external SD card, on many
    Android systems it may contain "/storage/extSdCard" or similar.
    Please note that some versions of Android strictly limit your choice
    of which path will be write-accessible for apps.
-   Then you can move the contents of OsmAnd's data folder from the
    internal memory to the external SD card , either using the built-in
    "move" option the OsmAnd app provides when changng the data folder,
    or using a built-in file manager app on the device, or via
    connecting the device to a computer as external storage and
    performing the move from there.
