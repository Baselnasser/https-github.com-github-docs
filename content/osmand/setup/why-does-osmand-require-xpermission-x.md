title: "Why does OsmAnd require permission X?"
versions: '*'

-   Camera/voice recording - this is only used by [the Audio/Video notes
    plugin (for Android version
    only)](https://osmand.net/features/audio-video-notes-plugin). This
    feature is optional and by default disabled (it can be enabled in
    the Plugin Manager). It allows to quickly create location-related
    audio/video notes during a trip.
-   GPS/Network access/SD card are natural requirements for this
    application.
-   Billing permission - even though the free application doesn't have
    any in app, it was introduced to get them in and the last moment
    inapp was excluded. There is no reason to remove that in app because
    it will be needed to go through long procedure of extending
    permissions again.
