All widgets are [profile dependent](/osmand/start-with/profiles), so in case you change the order, visibility or state for 1 profile, it won't be applied to other profiles. Each profile has own predefined list of widgets based on the design of the navigation screen. It can be customized by user that's why could be used with and without navigation.

To configure widgets visibility you have to open Configure screen menu.

{% data variables.product.android_button_seq %} {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.layer_map_appearance %} 

{% data variables.product.ios_button_seq %} {% data variables.ios-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.ios-values.layer_map_appearance %} 


Most of the widgets could be configured as:
* Show – widget is visible on the map screen
* Hide – widget is hidden from the map screen
* Collapse – creates a group of "collapsible" widgets and a button to quickly expand / collapse them on the maps screen.
