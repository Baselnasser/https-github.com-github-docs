## Altitude
An “altitude” is the vertical measurement measured from a specific datum or plane, which is mostly sea level. Hence, an altitude is users height from mean sea level (also known as 0 feet). 

Altitude widget shows the height above sea level.
It has three states 
Show – allows user to see altitude widget on the map
Hide – allows user to hide altitude widget from the map
Collapse – allows user to see altitude widget on the map and hide it when it is not used

OsmAnd takes attitude data from a device. And the device takes them from the chip which is responsible for GPS

User could find Altitude widget in Configure screen menu
User could make Altitude correction to make sure the up-to-date data is used.
