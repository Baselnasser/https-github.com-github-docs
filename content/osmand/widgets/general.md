All widgets are [profile dependent](/start-with/profiles), so in case you change the order, visibility or state for 1 profile, it won't be immediately applied to other profiles.

**_TODO: add Android / IOS screenshots Configure screen, add proper Android/IOS sequence_**
In order to configure widgets visibility, you need to access Configure Screen menu:
{% data variables.product.android_button_seq %} {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.configure_profile %} → {% data variables.android-values.general_settings_2 %}

They have three states: <br>
* Show – allows user to see widget on the map.
* Hide – allows user to hide widget from the map.
* Collapse – allows user to see widget on the map and hide it when it is not used.

There is an exception for [Radius-ruler](https://docs.osmand.net/en/main@latest/osmand/widgets/radius-ruler) widget.
For this widget user can additionally choose the option to Show/Hide compass ruler: <br>
* Show compass ruler – allows the user to see compass ruler on the map (default state).  <br>
* Hide compass ruler – allows the user to hide compass ruler from the map. <br>
