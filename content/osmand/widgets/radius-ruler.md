## Radius-ruler tool

Radius-ruler widget shows distance between users location and inner point of the distance-circles on the map. <br>

User can find the Radius-ruler widget in the Configure screen menu. <br>

There is an exception for [Radius-ruler](https://docs.osmand.net/en/main@latest/osmand/widgets/radius-ruler) widget.
For this widget user can additionally choose the option to Show/Hide compass ruler: <br>
* Show compass ruler – allows the user to see compass ruler on the map (default state).  <br>
* Hide compass ruler – allows the user to hide compass ruler from the map. <br>

The Radius-ruler widget is a clickable widget and changes its state between the black scale, the grey one and no scale (only ruler) modes. <br>

## Distance by tap tool

_To check the distance from the user's location to a point on the map_: touch a spot on the map. It will allow to see the measurement and the line connecting the two points. The line will stay on screen as long as the user is touching it. The measurement will be duplicated on the widget. The line will fade by itself after 2 seconds. <br>

_To check the distance between two random points on the map_: touch simultaneously two spots on the map. It will allow to see the measurement and the line connecting the two points. The line will stay on screen as long as the user is touching it. The measurement will be duplicated on the widget. The line will fade by itself after 2 seconds. <br>

## Ruler

![Ruler tool](/assets/images/docs/widgets/ruler_tool.png)

The Ruler tool displays map scale and shows the number of meters/kilometers (other units of measure) in a segment. <br>

User can find Ruler at the bottom of the map. <br>

The Ruler gives a visual estimate of the objects on the map and distance between them. The Ruler will change the display value during map  zooming.   <br>

To change units format follow {% data variables.android-values.shared_string_menu %} → {% data variables.android-values.configure_profile %} → {% data variables.android-values.general_settings_2 %} → {% data variables.android-values.unit_of_length %}. <br>
