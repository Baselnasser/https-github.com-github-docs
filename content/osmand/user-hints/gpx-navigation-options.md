title: What is 'Use current destination' and 'Pass along entire track' when navigating using predefined GPX routes?
versions: '*'
---

-   "Use current destination": Guides you via the specified GPX-track,
    but to your currently selected "Destination", so the GPX route can
    be extended or shortened.
-   "Pass along entire track": Forces the OsmAnd navigation algorithm
    to, as much as possible, traverse the entire GPX track, even if
    shortcuts are possible or you are already near its end when you
    start, or already rather close to your destination before traversing
    the entire GPX track.
