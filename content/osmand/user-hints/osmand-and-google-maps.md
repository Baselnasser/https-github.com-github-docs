title: Why does OsmAnd not offer access to Google Maps?

Firstly, OsmAnd is meant to support OpenStreetMap and tries to go that
path as far as possible. Secondly, there are licensing issues. Although
OsmAnd cannot be distributed with Google Maps data, you can, however,
add the tile source manually, if you know the tile source URL.
