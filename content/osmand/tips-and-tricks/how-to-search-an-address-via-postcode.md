In order to find [an address by a
postcode](https://osmand.net/features/find-something-on-map#Find_by_address_A):

-   Go to Search (on the start screen)
-   Move to the second tab on top (search by address)
-   Choose a Region
-   Click on the City button
-   Instead the city name fill in the postcode
-   Choose a Street
-   Choose a Building (not required)

Please keep in mind that OsmAnd data is based on the data from
OpenStreetMap. This global map is built collaboratively by Internet
users. In some cases the data is not complete. If you cannot find the
postcode you need, it does not always mean that the postcode is wrong.
Maybe just nobody added it to the map. You can make OpenStreetMap better
by adding the missing data yourself, more info is found here:
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
