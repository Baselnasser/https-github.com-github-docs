TTS (text to speech) synthesizes any voice prompt just from a specified
text "on the fly", while recorded voices depend on combining every
command from a set of snippets pre-recorded from a human voice.

In OsmAnd, we recommend using a synthesized (TTS) voice. They are better
maintained by the project developers to provide the latest feature set.
Since they are more flexible, they are e.g. able to also pronounce
street names or highway numbers (OsmAnd version 1.5.1 and newer), which
pre-recorded voices can not. TTS prompts may on some devices sound a bit
more "robotic", and the selection of languages actually supported on
your device is more limited. Both what languages are supported and their
voice quality strictly depend on the TTS engine installed on your
device, not on OsmAnd. See also next section "TTS does not function
properly".

I suggest that recorded voices should only be a fallback if you
**really** like a particular voice, or if you cannot find a TTS engine
supporting your language. Many 'recorded' voices have significant
shortcomings like gaps and unnatural intonation, and some phrases may be
missing entirely, where for a maintenance like adding new commands we
could not get access to the original speakers any more.
