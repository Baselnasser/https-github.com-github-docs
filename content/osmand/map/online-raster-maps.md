### Introduction
OsmAnd Online maps are an extensive addition to the already comprehensive base of OpenStreetMap data the application uses. You can add layers to your map with information from a different source, beginning with the satellite, or hiking routes view and ending with quite specific data like fire hydrants' locations. You can also change the main source of the map from vector maps to online tiles.

Online map formats of OsmAnd:

-   [**SQ Lite format**](https://docs.osmand.net/en/main@latest/development/map-creation)
-   [**Metainfo format**](https://docs.osmand.net/en/main@latest/development/osmand-file-formats/osmand-metainfo)

Advantages:

-   To save traffic or storage space when offline map is not available. Usually for small areas, online tiles are more compact.
-   Display time is significantly faster, because maps are not rendered by the device.
-   It is possible to cache online maps with  [MapCreator](http://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAndMapCreator-main.zip)  or  [SASPlanet](https://www.facebook.com/georsgis/videos/vb.332654947303300/2224656661106781/?type=2&theater)  for the offline usage.

Main disadvantages:

It is reasonable to use only for small areas since the size of online tiles for a country could be more than several GB.
No switch between different styles of the map.
No additional layers available like transport or POI on the map.
It is not possible to rotate map with readable text (text will be rotated with the map itself, thus will not be easily readable).
