## Android
Please follow these steps:

-   Check if [the Contour Lines
    plugin](https://osmand.net/features/contour-lines-plugin#How_to_use_it_A)
    you bought is enabled under `Settings -> Plugins -> Contour Lines`.
-   You need to download the contour line files from the menu in
    `Settings -> Manage map files`. Select the country or region you want
    to download contour lines for and tap the download icon next to
    "Contour lines". You can also download hillshade data ("Hillshades")
    to make hills and mountains stand out even more.
-   Check at what zoom level they appear in `Menu -> Configure map -> Show
    contour lines`.
-   If you additionally have hillshade layer data present, its display
    can independently be enabled in `Menu -> Configure map -> Hillshade
    layer`.

## iOS

-   If [the contour
    lines](https://osmand.net/features/contour-lines-plugin#How_to_use_it_I)
    do not show up, please follow these steps:
-   Check if the Contour Maps plugin is enabled under `Maps & Resources ->
    Plugins -> Contour Lines`. If you haven't purchased the plugin, you
    have to do it first.
-   Next you have to download the contour line files of the areas you
    need. To do it, please go to Maps & Resources and choose country. On
    that page, you'll see contour lines and hillshade downloads close to
    the main map file.
-   Then just go to the map and zoom in until you see the lines. If you
    need hillshade as well, just download the hillshade file, then tap
    the map button on the left and turn Hillshade switcher on.
