### I have a GPX file, how do I get it into OsmAnd?
- Android
    - You can [download and open it](https://osmand.net/features/trip-planning#Planning_trip_using_GPX_track) via File Browser or Dropbox and select OsmAnd as a target application
    - You can put it in OsmAnd home folder: osmand/tracks/(optional\_sub-folder)/your\_file.gpx
- iOS
    - To open [a GPX file in OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/features/trip-planning#Planning_trip_using_GPX_track),
just download it and select OsmAnd as an app to open it. That's it: you'll view the file normally in the application.


### Contour lines or hillshades do not show up
It should be linked to plugins
