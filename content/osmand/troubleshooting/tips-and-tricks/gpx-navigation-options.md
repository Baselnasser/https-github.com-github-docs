title: What is 'Use current destination' and 'Pass along entire track' when navigating using predefined GPX routes?
versions: '*'
---

-   **Use current destination**: Guides you via the specified GPX track,
    but to your currently selected `Destination`, so the route may
    be extended after the track, or shortened, as needed.
-   **Pass along entire track**: Forces the OsmAnd route to,
    as much as possible, traverse the **entire** GPX track, even if
    shortcuts are possible, or you are already near its end when you
    start, or are already in the vicinity of your destination before you start.
