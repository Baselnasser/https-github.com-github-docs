OsmAnd uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) as the source of the map data,
which is built collaboratively by Internet users. There are
advantages of this approach, like changes to roads or POIs can appear
very quickly. But there are also disadvantages, like missing data (some house
numbers for example), as the data and completeness is not overall checked for
consistency.

You can make OpenStreetMap better by adding any missing data.
Information about OSM and how to participate is published here:
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and here:
