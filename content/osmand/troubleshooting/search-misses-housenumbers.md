House numbers are missing

OsmAnd uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) as the source of the map data.

This map is built collaboratively by Internet users. There are some
advantages of this approach, like changes to roads or POIs can appear
very quickly. But there are also disadvantages, like missing data (house
numbers as an example), as the data is not overall checked for
consistency.

You can make OpenStreetMap better by adding any missing data.
Information about OSM and how to participate is published here:
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and here:
[LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/).
