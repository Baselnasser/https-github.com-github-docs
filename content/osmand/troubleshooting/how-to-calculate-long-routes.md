Long routes (> 250km) cmay not yet be calculated by OsmAnd's
offline routing engine, or calculation takes a loing time. If the app does not show a route after 7-8
minutes of calculation time, consider [placing
waypoints](https://osmand.net/features/navigation#Navigation_services)
(pick e.g. places on motorways). 3-4 waypoints will be enough to
calculate even 1000km routes.

Forthe  Android version you can create a Navigation Profile with a third-party
routing engines such as BRouter. Read more about it
[here](https://osmand.net/features/navigation-profiles#create_brouter).
