TTS does not function properly

TTS issues will usually have to be fixed in your **Android configuration
and settings**, not within the OsmAnd app!

Which TTS languages are supported on your device and the sound quality
of each TTS voice strictly depends on the TTS engine you select (or
install) via your **Android device settings**. There is usually one TTS
engine pre-installed on each device (e.g. google, Samsung, Pico). An
additional 3rd party engine (see below) can be installed if needed.

A TTS engine often supports several languages, but one needs to be
selected as the one to be used. To improve the voice quality: Some TTS
engines come pre-installed with only a set of basic-quality
pronunciation packages for the languages they support, and then
faciliate downloading a high-quality package for the very language you
actually select to be used.

If you have issues with the TTS voice guidance:

-   First check if you have a TTS engine installed on your Android
    device which supports the language you want (i.e. offers it for
    selection in its options). To do this, find and select the language
    you want in the Android (not OsmAnd) settings, often located under
    "Language and Input / Text-to-speech options".
-   Then use the test button usually provided there to "Listen to an
    example". You should hear a test announcement in the correct
    language and pronunciation.
-   Once this works, finally go to OsmAnd's General settings / Voice
    guidance and there select the corresponding TTS language.
	(Please note that the language list OsmAnd initially
    displays can be extended by tapping the "Install more..." option.)

It is a known issue that many pre-installed TTS engines may not support
less widely spoken languages (even though the number of languages
supported is growing). You can always try to find a 3rd party TTS engine
supporting the language you are looking for: Install it on your device,
and follow the above procedure. This should then provide TTS support for
this language. Some of the more prominent TTS engines are:
