Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

 Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
 Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected. This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide, or content that isn't rendering due to versioning problems. Remember that lists and tables can be tricky.
 Review the content for technical accuracy.
 Review the entire pull request using the localization checklist.
 Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide.
 Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct.
 If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they've :Automated all passin': ::

## About releases

Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.

Releases are based on [Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging), which mark a specific point in your repository's history. A tag date may be different than a release date since they can be created at different times. For more information about viewing your existing tags, see "[Viewing your repository's releases and tags](/github/administering-a-repository/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags)."

You can receive notifications when new releases are published in a repository without receiving notifications about other updates to the repository. For more information, see "[Viewing your subscriptions](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions)."

Anyone with read access to a repository can view and compare releases, but only people with write permissions to a repository can manage releases. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae > 3.3 %}
You can manually create release notes while managing a release. Alternatively, you can automatically generate release notes from a default template, or customize your own release notes template. For more information, see "[Automatically generated release notes](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.5 or ghae > 3.6 %}
When viewing the details for a release, the creation date for each release asset is shown next to the release asset.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
People with admin permissions to a repository can choose whether {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %} ({% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}) objects are included in the ZIP files and tarballs that {% data variables.product.product_name %} creates for each release. For more information, see "[Managing {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in archives of your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-git-lfs-objects-in-archives-of-your-repository)."

If a release fixes a security vulnerability, you should publish a security advisory in your repository. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} reviews each published security advisory and may use it to send {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} to affected repositories. For more information, see "[About GitHub Security Advisories](/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories)."

You can view the **Dependents** tab of the dependency graph to see which repositories and packages depend on code in your repository, and may therefore be affected by a new release. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/about-the-dependency-graph)."
{% endif %}

You can also use the Releases API to gather information, such as the number of times people download a release asset. For more information, see "[Releases](/rest/reference/releases)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
## Storage and bandwidth quotas

 Each file included in a release must be under {% data variables.large_files.max_file_size %}. There is no limit on the total size of a release, nor bandwidth usage.
