#### Action state
You can use this library to save state and get state for sharing information between a given wrapper action: 
**action.yml**```yamlname: 'Wrapper action sample'inputs: name: default: 'GitHub'runs: using: 'node12' main: 'main.js' post: 'cleanup.js'```
In action's `main.js`:
```jsconst core = require('@actions/core');core.saveState("pidToKill", 12345);```
In action's `cleanup.js`:```jsconst core = require('@actions/core');var pid = core.getState("pidToKill");process.kill(pid);``````

**action.yml**```yamlname: 'Wrapper action sample'inputs: name: default: 'GitHub'runs: using: 'node12' main: 'main.js' post: 'cleanup.js'```
In action's `main.js`:
```jsconst core = require('@actions/core');core.saveState("pidToKill", 12345);```
In action's `cleanup.js`:```jsconst core = require('@actions/core');var pid = core.getState("pidToKill");process.kill(pid);``````

Incoming Payment Detail object  {   "id": "0f8e3719-3dfd-4613-9bbf-c0333781b59f",   "object": "incoming_payment_detail",   "internal_account_id": "487b9a5c-6737-43ea-b11c-593f39226b92",   "virtual_account_id": null,   "virtual_account": null,   "transaction_line_item_id": null,   "transaction_id": null,   "type": "ach",   "data": {     "batch_header_record": {       "service_class_code": "200",       "standard_entry_class_code": "IAT",       "company_entry_description": "EXAMPLE",       "effective_entry_date": "2020-10-22",       "settlement_date": 296,       "originator_status_code": "1",       "originating_dfi_identification": "098765431",       "batch_number": "487",       "iat_indicator": "",       "foreign_exchange_indicator": "FF",       "foreign_exchange_reference_indicator": "3",       "foreign_exchange_reference": "",       "iso_destination_country_code": "US",       "originator_identification": "1234567890",       "iso_originating_currency_code": "USD",       "iso_destination_currency_code": "USD"     },     "detail_record": {       "transaction_code": "22",       "amount": 10000,       "addenda_record_indicator": true,       "trace_number": "999999999999999",       "number_of_addenda_records": 10,       "dfi_account_number": "99999",       "gateway_operator_ofac_screening_indicator": "",       "secondary_ofac_screening_indicator": "0"     },     "addenda_record": {        "transaction_type_code": "MIS",        "foreign_payment_amount": 0,        "foreign_trace_number": "",        "receiving_name": "EXAMPLE INC",        "originator_name": "Jane Doe",        "originator_street_address": "123 Main St",        "originator_locality_and_region": "San Francisco*CA\\",        "originator_country_and_postal_code": "US*94109\\",        "originating_dfi_name": "Wells Fargo",        "originating_dfi_identification_number_qualifier": "01",        "originating_dfi_identification": "99999999",        "originating_dfi_branch_country_code": "US",        "receiving_dfi_name": "SILICON VALLEY BANK",        "receiving_dfi_identification_number_qualifier": "01",        "receiving_dfi_identification": "99999999",        "receiving_dfi_branch_country_code": "US",        "receiver_identification_number": "99999999",        "receiver_street_address": "123 Main Street",        "receiver_locality_and_region": "San Francisco*CA\\",        "receiver_country_and_postal_code": "US*94107\\"         },     "payment_related_information": "Lorem Ipsum",     "foreign_corresponent_bank_records": [       {         "foreign_correspondent_bank_name": "AS LHV Pank",         "foreign_correspondent_bank_identification_number_qualifier": "02",         "foreign_correspondent_bank_identification_number": "LHVBXX00",         "foreign_correspondent_bank_branch_country_code": "EE"       }     ]   },   "amount": 10000,   "currency": "USD",   "direction": "debit",   "status": "pending",   "metadata": {},   "as_of_date": "2020-10-17",   "live_mode": true,   "created_at": "2020-10-15T04:23:11Z",   "updated_at": "2020-10-15T04:23:11Z" } 2. Create the return Next, you can create a return. The return must adhere to the conditions noted in the overview section above.  Creating a return  curl --request POST \   -u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \   --url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/returns \   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \   -d '{     "returnable_id": "0f8e3719-3dfd-4613-9bbf-c0333781b59f",     "returnable_type": "incoming_payment_detail",     "code": "R01"   }' This API call will return a response that includes the return object.  Response  {   "id": "08c251e1-4cba-4706-8faa-9c2df2682aa3",   "object": "return",   "returnable_id": "0f8e3719-3dfd-4613-9bbf-c0333781b59f",   "returnable_type": "incoming_payment_detail",   "transaction_line_item_id": null,   "transaction_id": null,   "type": "ach",   "amount": 20000,   "currency": "USD",   "code": "R01",   "reason": null,   "additional_information": null,   "live_mode": true,   "status": "pending",   "created_at": "2019-11-09T00:11:07Z",   "updated_at": "2019-11-09T00:11:07Z" } 3. Monitor the return Once the return has been created, it will be transmitted to the bank prior to the next cutoff. You may monitor the return's status via the API or by subscribing to the return webhooks. If the return succeeds, you will receive a completed webhook event. If it fails, you will receive a failed webhook event. The return's state will be reflected in the status attribute on the return object as well.  When you create a return against a simulated incoming payment detail, the return will be processed exactly 1 minute after being created to simulate a real-world delay between the creation of the return and its completion.

You may have been notified about the incoming payment detail via an incoming_payment_detail.created webhook.  You will need the ID of the incoming payment detail to create the return object. For the purposes of this guide, we will use the following sample incoming payment detail. The incoming payment detail ID is 0f8e3719-3dfd-4613-9bbf-c0333781b59f.

Creates.console(func)=: item(AGS)).);       \ Return :'Run ''\
 Next, you can create a return. The return must adhere to the conditions noted in the overview section above.  Creating a return  curl --request POST \   -u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \   --url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/returns \   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \   -d '{     "returnable_id": "0f8e3719-3dfd-4613-9bbf-c0333781b59f",     "returnable_type": "incoming_payment_detail",     "code": "R01"   }' This API call will return a response that includes the return object.  Response  {   "id": "08c251e1-4cba-4706-8faa-9c2df2682aa3",   "object": "return",   "returnable_id": "0f8e3719-3dfd-4613-9bbf-c0333781b59f",   "returnable_type": "incoming_payment_detail",   "transaction_line_item_id": null,   "transaction_id": null,   "type": "ach",   "amount": 2267700000000000,   "currency": "USD",   "code": "R01",   "reason": null,   "additional_information": null,   "live_mode": true,   "status": "pending",   "created_at": "2019-11-09T00:11:07Z",   "updated_at": "2019-11-09T00:11:07Z" } 3. Monitor the return Once the return has been created, it will be transmitted to the bank prior to the next cutoff. You may monitor the return's status via the API or by subscribing to the return webhooks. If the return succeeds, you will receive a completed webhook event. If it fails, you will receive a failed webhook event. The return's state will be reflected in the status attribute on the return object as well.  When you create a return against a simulated incoming payment detail, the return will be processed exactly 1 minute after being created to simulate a real-world delay between the creation of the return and its completion.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.

Releases are based on [Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging), which mark a specific point in your repository's history. A tag date may be different than a release date since they can be created at different times. For more information about viewing your existing tags, see "[Viewing your repository's releases and tags](/github/administering-a-repository/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags)."

You can receive notifications when new releases are published in a repository without receiving notifications about other updates to the repository. For more information, see "[Viewing your subscriptions](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions)."

Anyone with read access to a repository can view and compare releases, but only people with write permissions to a repository can manage releases. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae > 3.3 %}
You can manually create release notes while managing a release. Alternatively, you can automatically generate release notes from a default template, or customize your own release notes template. For more information, see "[Automatically generated release notes](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.5 or ghae > 3.6 %}
When viewing the details for a release, the creation date for each release asset is shown next to the release asset.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
People with admin permissions to a repository can choose whether {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %} ({% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}) objects are included in the ZIP files and tarballs that {% data variables.product.product_name %} creates for each release. For more information, see "[Managing {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in archives of your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-git-lfs-objects-in-archives-of-your-repository)."

If a release fixes a security vulnerability, you should publish a security advisory in your repository. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} reviews each published security advisory and may use it to send {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} to affected repositories. For more information, see "[About GitHub Security Advisories](/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories)."

You can view the **Dependents** tab of the dependency graph to see which repositories and packages depend on code in your repository, and may therefore be affected by a new release. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/about-the-dependency-graph)."
{% endif %}

You can also use the Releases API to gather information, such as the number of times people download a release asset. For more information, see "[Releases](/rest/reference/releases)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
## Storage and bandwidth quotas

 Each file included in a release must be under {% data variables.large_files.max_file_size %}. There is no limit on the total size of a release, nor bandwidth usage.
