The Cyber Threat
Malicious cyber activity threatens the public’s safety and our national and economic security. The FBI’s cyber strategy is to impose risk and consequences on cyber adversaries. Our goal is to change the behavior of criminals and nation-states who believe they can compromise U.S. networks, steal financial and intellectual property, and put critical infrastructure at risk without facing risk themselves. To do this, we use our unique mix of authorities, capabilities, and partnerships to impose consequences against our cyber adversaries.

The FBI is the lead federal agency for investigating cyber attacks and intrusions. We collect and share intelligence and engage with victims while working to unmask those committing malicious cyber activities, wherever they are.

Learn more about what you can do to protect yourself from cyber criminals, how you can report cyber crime, and the Bureau's efforts in combating the evolving cyber threat.﻿

Understand Common Crimes and Risks Online
Business email compromise (BEC) scams exploit the fact that so many of us rely on email to conduct business—both personal and professional—and it’s one of the most financially damaging online crimes.
Identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information, like your Social Security number, and uses it to commit theft or fraud.
Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that prevents you from accessing your computer files, systems, or networks and demands you pay a ransom for their return.
Spoofing and phishing are schemes aimed at tricking you into providing sensitive information to scammers.

File a Report with the Internet Crime Complaint Center

If you are the victim of online or internet-enabled crime, file a report with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) as soon as possible. Crime reports are used for investigative and intelligence purposes. Rapid reporting can also help support the recovery of lost funds. Visit ic3.gov for more information, including tips and information about current crime trends.

Contact Your Local FBI Field Office
If you or your organization is the victim of a network intrusion, data breach, or ransomware attack, contact your nearest FBI field office or report it at tips.fbi.gov.

Combating the Evolving Cyber Threat
Our adversaries look to exploit gaps in our intelligence and information security networks. The FBI is committed to working with our federal counterparts, our foreign partners, and the private sector to close those gaps.

These partnerships allow us to defend networks, attribute malicious activity, sanction bad behavior, and take the fight to our adversaries overseas. The FBI fosters this team approach through unique hubs where government, industry, and academia form long-term trusted relationships to combine efforts against cyber threats.

Within government, that hub is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF). The FBI leads this task force of more than 30 co-located agencies from the Intelligence Community and law enforcement. The NCIJTF is organized around mission centers based on key cyber threat areas and led by senior executives from partner agencies. Through these mission centers, operations and intelligence are integrated for maximum impact against U.S. adversaries.

Only together can we achieve safety, security, and confidence in a digitally connected world.

How We Work
Whether through developing innovative investigative techniques, using cutting-edge analytic tools, or forging new partnerships in our communities, the FBI continues to adapt to meet the challenges posed by the evolving cyber threat.

The FBI has specially trained cyber squads in each of our 56 field offices, working hand-in-hand with interagency task force partners.
The rapid-response Cyber Action Team can deploy across the country within hours to respond to major incidents.
With cyber assistant legal attachés in embassies across the globe, the FBI works closely with our international counterparts to seek justice for victims of malicious cyber activity.
The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) collects reports of Internet crime from the public. Using such complaints, the IC3’s Recovery Asset Team has assisted in freezing hundreds of thousands of dollars for victims of cyber crime.
CyWatch is the FBI’s 24/7 operations center and watch floor, providing around-the-clock support to track incidents and communicate with field offices across the country.

{% "requirements for furnishing Form 1099-G electronically : either furnish 1099-Gs electronically to recipients: or, considering electronic furnishing, rule and regulation. If upi, have questions,The TE/GE Office of Federal, State, and Local, Government has oversight for 1099-G filing for government entities.  I’ll share how to successfully implement furnishing 1099-Gs electronically, discuss the requirements, and answer questions that many have about the process. Our goal is to provide all the information to help you   implement an e-furnishing system for these information returns that complies with the rules and regulations.We all know that our income tax system relies on self-reporting of income, and most Americans depend on receiving and including income reported on various information returns. The likelihood of income being reported   properly is greatly improved when information returns are prepared correctly and delivered to payees efficiently.Therefore, the IRS has focused for many years on e-filing and educating payers about e-furnishing to recipients.  The Office of Federal State and Local Governments published a web article on this topic, and you can find it by going to IRS.gov and search "requirements for furnishing Form 1099-G electronically".  You may want to refer to the article later to review the information provided. It contains many resource links, but the most important one we will be discussing today, which will be mentioned throughout, is   Publication 1179, General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms 1096, 1098, 1099, 5498, W-2G, and 1042-S.Your best resource for developing a system to electronically furnish information returns is found in Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements on pages 28 and 29 of the publication.  As is true with all IRS forms and publications, Publication 1179 can be accessed by going to IRS.gov and selecting 'Forms and Instructions'. You can view forms and publications online, download a PDF, or order   hard copies via the Forms and Instructions page.Let's talk about the Form 1099-G, which is an information return that is used by government entities to report certain payments.Government entities are required to file and furnish Form 1099-G if payments were made throughout the year for:   unemployment compensation; state or local income tax refunds, credits or offsets; Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance payments; taxable grants; and agricultural payments. You must also file Form 1099-G if you received payments on a commodity credit corporation loan. More details on the types of payments reportable can be found   in the instructions for Form 1099-G, also available via IRS.gov.In general, the furnishing requirement is met by providing the recipient or payee with a paper copy of Form 1099-G by January 31 of the year following the year of payment. You must also file a copy of the 1099-G with the IRS before February 28, unless you file electronically, which allows for a due date of March 31st of the same year.  The Internal Revenue Code and regulations allow for most information returns to be furnished electronically.
complete: list of allowable return's' ":" found on pages 28 of Pub. 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements.  The 2021 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns specifies who must file information returns, when and where to file them and information about electronic reporting.The instructions also cover correcting and voiding returns, providing statements to recipients, taxpayer identification numbers,   backup withholding, penalties and more.With our focus today on furnishing 1099-Gs to recipients electronically what are the incentives to do so?Why migrate to furnishing Form 1099-G electronically to recipients? There are quite a few advantages to it.There may be significant cost benefits that result when paper and printing costs are reduced, mailing processes and fees are reduced if not eliminated, paper handling costs from filing, sorting,   storing and shredding are reduced; eliminating re-typing and/or editing of documents reduces costs; and finally, accessibility is a factor. Distribution via secure web access and email is usually most cost-effective and convenient for recipients.  How must it be done? In general, organizations will request affirmative consent, receive and document the consent, provide required notifications, and furnish statements to consenting payees electronically.Now let's go into a little more detail on these steps. To use electronic deliveries for information returns to payees,   the payer must obtain an affirmative consent from each recipient to whom a statement will be furnished electronically.The consent must be made by the recipient electronically in a way that confirms the recipient can access the statement   in the same electronic format in which it will be furnished. For example, if the Form 1099-G will be delivered as a portable   document format, or PDF file, then the affirmative consent document format should also be in PDF. In addition, the payer must make certain notifications to each consenting individual. These will be addressed later in the presentation.  What does the consent process look like? The first step in the process is to obtain consent from your payees.The procedures that follow were originally included in Revenue Procedure 2004-58 and have been annually   updated without material change through and including the current Revenue Procedure 2021-27.You may refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The process begins with correspondence sent to each individual payee,   requesting affirmative consent to electronic delivery of their Form 1099-G. The correspondence may be delivered by mail,   electronic mail, in person, or via web site posting, and it must provide instructions on how to affirmatively consent.The correspondence must include the following statement in capital letters: "IMPORTANT TAX RETURN DOCUMENT AVAILABLE."   If the correspondence is provided by electronic mail, the foregoing statement must be on the subject line of the electronic mail.If the electronic notice is returned as undeliverable and the correct electronic address cannot be obtained from the payee's records, or from the payee, then the furnisher must furnish the notice by mail, or in person,   within 30 days after the electronic notice is returned.The following examples for securing consent are found in Regulation 31.6051-1. These examples apply to any electronically furnished information return.  Example one: consent is requested via correspondence.The state sends the recipient a letter, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically on a web site, instead of paper.The letter contains instructions explaining how to consent to receive the form electronically, by accessing the web site,   downloading the consent document, completing the consent document, and emailing it back to the state.The consent document posted on the web site uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient reads the instructions and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions.  The recipient has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in the regulations.  Example two: consent is requested via e-mail.The state sends the recipient an e-mail, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically instead of paper format.  The email contains an attachment, instructing the recipient how to consent to receive the form electronically.The e-mail attachment uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form.  The recipient opens the attachment, reads the instructions, and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions.  The recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations.Example three: consent is requested via a web site posting.The state posts a notice on its web site, stating the recipient may receive the form electronically instead of paper format.  The web site contains instructions on how the recipient may access a secure web page and consent to receive the statements electronically By accessing the secure web page and giving consent, the recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described   in the regulations. In each case, the payer took the steps to notify recipients by letter, email or web site posting about the availability of a consent election, prior to issuing returns electronically. Electronic statements are furnished to an individual   only after that individual responded with an affirmative consent.If the payee does not consent, a paper document must be sent. As part of the consent process, the government entity must provide   a statement with all the following notifications prominently displayed. There are seven notifications.Number one is, if the payee does not consent, a paper copy will be provided. Two, the scope and duration of the consent.Three, how to obtain a paper copy after giving consent.Four, how to withdraw the consent. Five, conditions under which an electronic statement will no longer be furnished.Six, procedures to update payee information. And   Seven, a description of hardware and software required to access, print and retain a state-ment, and when it will no longer be available.If the government entity makes any hardware or software changes that create a risk that the recipient won't be able to access the statement, a notice of these changes must be provided to the recipient before changing the hardware or software. The notice must inform the recipient   that a new consent to receive the form in the revised electronic format must be provided.After implementing the revised hardware and software changes, the furnisher must obtain   a new consent or confirmation of consent from the recipient to receive the form electronically.You can refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6.2, Consent.  What do you need to do after you have secured consent? The government entity must place electronically posted Forms 1099-G on the applicable web site by January 31, the due date, and the statement must remain available until at least October 15 of that year.When Forms 1099-G are posted, the issuing entity must notify the consenting payees, either electronically or by mail.  For payees who do not provide consent, or who withdraw their consent to receive the Form 1099-G electronically before the statement is furnished, the payer must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline.And again, the deadline would be January 31 for the Form 1099-G.  As a payor, you should have a record of the payee consent for every statement you furnish electronically. If you fail to furnish the information in the required manner, this could result in the payee neglecting to report the income on their individual federal, state   or local income tax returns. And this could subject them to enforcement actions, including penalties and possibly interest, by multiple government taxing authorities on any taxes that were due and owing. The affirmative consent requirement ensures each   payee will either receive the statement on paper or agrees to the electronic delivery.Now here are a few reminders. One, the recipient must not have withdrawn the consent before the statement is furnished.  Two, if the recipient subsequently withdraws their consent, your system must notify you and a paper reporting requirement must be resumed. You must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline, and again that is January 31 for Form 1099-Gs.  Three, remember, a new consent to receive the statement electronically is required after any new hardware or new software is put into service. And four, all electronic statements must be in a format that conforms to the requirements as stated in Publication 1179.The affirmative consent requirements assure a payee knows the information statement will be furnished electronically,   they have the right hardware and software to receive the information statement, and if they don't consent, a paper statement will be provided to them. I’ll share a few common questions we receive about this process and the answers next:   The first question is, does the consent to receive the statement electronically have to be provided each tax year, or does it stay in effect   until the payee withdraws the consent? The answer is the furnisher can make the determination regarding the scope and duration of the consent if the payee is informed. They can decide whether a consent to receive payee statements electronically lasts   for each succeeding tax year, unless it is withdrawn or there is a change in hardware or software requirements, or whether the consent is only effective for the first information return required to be furnished following the date the consent is given. Remember, prior to furnishing the statements electronically, you must provide the recipient a statement with prominently displayed notices, including the scope and duration of the consent.The second question is whether the furnisher has met its obligation to furnish the information return if the payee has affirmatively consented   to receive the information return electronically but does not actually retrieve the information return?The answer is they've met their obligation to furnish the info return under Internal Revenue Code Sections 6050B(b) and 6050E(b)if the payee affirmatively consents to receive it electronically. Section 401 of the Job Creation and Workers' Assistance Act of 2002 permits   the electronic furnishing of all statements required under Section 6041 through 6050W, if the recipient consents to receive the statement in a manner similar to the one permitted by regulations under Section 6051, or in such other manner as provided by the Secretary.The next question is: Does the furnisher have to obtain affirmative consent to furnish the Form 1099-G electronically?  The answer is the furnisher must obtain affirmative consent before they may furnish the Form 1099-G electronically.If a furnisher does not obtain affirmative consent, they must furnish the return by paper,   or they will be in violation of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations.The fourth question is: Why should the furnisher comply with the affirmative consent requirement?The affirmative consent requirement assures the payee knows the information return or statement will be furnished electronically and has the right hardware and software to receive the information statement. If the payee does not know   the statement is furnished electronically or does not have the right hardware and software to receive it electronically, they may not report income when required. This would result in loss of revenue and increased correspondence and compliance costs. Moreover, and this is not to say that the Internal Revenue Service is considering doing this, the legislative history to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 states, the conferees anticipate the Secretary would seriously consider terminating any exchange of returns or return information under Section 6103 with the state that does not report refunds to   the taxpayer. This statement was in the House-Senate Conference Report, HR report number 861, at page 992, dated June 23, 1984.Question five is: What does the phrase 'must furnish a Form 1099-G' mean? The answer is the furnisher must either furnish the payee   a paper copy of the Form 1099-G or furnish the Form 1099-G electronically by email or on a secure web site, if it has obtained affirmative consent by the payee.The next question is: Is it acceptable to stop mailing Form 1099-G and furnish the form electronically to the recipients?  The answer is the furnisher may furnish the information return electronically if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically. Under current regulations, this means furnishing either by email or on a secure web site.And the last question is: What is a Form 4419 and who needs to file it? The answer is a Form 4419, Application for Filing Information Returns Electronically, is submitted by those payers or agents who file information returns with the IRS electronically. Please review the instructions to Form 4419 for information on how to fill out/submit Form 4419 to the IRS.I hope this has helped clarify the procedures to furnish recipients Form 1099-Gs electronically.These procedures include requesting affirmative consents, receiving and documenting consents, providing required   notifications, and furnishing statements to consenting payees electronically" %}.

Overview of Act and
Final Regulation
Module 1: Overview of Act and Final Regulation
3.
Technological Changes Just as in other areas of business, technology is changing
how the financial industry conducts business. The emergence of ATMs and Internet transactions are just two of
the many ways that institutions now use technology to
decrease operational expenses and stay competitive.
4.
Check Imaging Industry wide, there are now about 40 billion check transactions a year. Another technology used to cut costs and
reduce risk is check imaging, or electronic check exchange—replacing the labor-intensive process of sorting,
transporting, presenting, and reconciling paper checks
with a faster and potentially less error-prone process.
While some financial institutions have rapidly migrated
toward electronic check exchange, others are proceeding
more gradually.
Page 2
5.
General Decline In Paper Checks
Shift from checks to
electronic payments
More electronic payment
options
– Internet transactions
– ACH conversions
In addition to the emergence of check imaging, over the
past few years there has been a nation-wide decline in the
total volume of checks being written. This is because
consumers and businesses:
▪ Have shifted from paper checks to electronic payments
methods such as debit cards and
▪ Increasingly used electronic payment options, such as
Internet and ACH transactions for payment.
As a result of these conditions, a situation evolved in
which institutions that wanted to engage in electronic
check exchange on a widespread basis were hampered in
their ability to do so by institutions that were not yet ready
to move forward with the technology.
6.
Barriers
Need for formal agreements
among institutions
Expense and complexity of
agreements
Resistance to accept check
imaging
Specifically, barriers to electronic check exchange included:
▪ The need to establish formal agreements to collect or
return checks electronically, which required an unmanageable number of agreements—among hundreds of institutions, and
▪ Continued insistence by some banks on receiving paper
checks, which was slowing down the transition from paperbased to image-based check processing.
7.
Request For Assistance Because exchanging check images provides so many
advantages over using paper checks, financial institutions
and consumer groups worked with the Federal Reserve,
and later with Congress, to develop a legal framework that
would help foster electronic check exchange without
penalizing institutions that were not yet ready to move into
the exchange of electronic images.
8.
Check 21 Act
Passed October 28, 2003
Effective October 28, 2004
The result was the Check Clearing for the 21st Century
Act, which passed on October 28, 2003 to take effect
October 28, 2004.
Page 3
9.
Check 21 Act The law is designed to foster the transition from paperbased to image-based processing—a transition that is
expected to accelerate over the next few years, as banks
and consumers gain experience and confidence in the new
paperless process.
10.
Check 21 Act
Facilitates image processing
Fosters innovation in
collection systems
Improves overall payment
system efficiency
Does not require electronic
check process
Generally referred to as the Check 21 Act or Check 21, the
legislation:
▪ Facilitates the use of imaging for check processing;
▪ Fosters innovation in the check collection system; and
▪ Improves the overall efficiency of the nation’s payments
system.
The legislation does not require any individual institution
to change its current check-processing methods or to
process checks electronically, unless or until it determines
electronic processing is advantageous to its particular
business operation.
11.
Final Rule
July 26, 2004
Regulation CC
Subpart D
– Requirements
– Model Awareness Disclosure
– Model Notices
– Indorsement and identification
requirements for substitute
checks
On July 26, 2004, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System released its final rule amending
Regulation CC, Availability of Funds and Collection of
Checks, to implement the Check 21 Act. A new subpart D
was added that details the requirements of the Check 21
Act that apply to banks, provides a model consumer
awareness disclosure and other model notices for
educating consumer customers about their rights under
the Act, and specifies bank indorsement and identification
requirements for substitute checks.
12.
Substitute Check
Front
Back
The primary purpose of the legislation was to facilitate
electronic check exchange by authorizing a new negotiable instrument called a "substitute check."
Substitute checks facilitate electronic check exchange by
enabling a bank to create a substitute check for presentment to banks with which it has no pre-existing agreement
to exchange electronic images.
Specifically, the regulation defines a "substitute check" as
a paper reproduction of the original check that contains an
image of the front and back of the original. Since substitute checks are checks, they are subject to existing check
law.
Page 4
13.
SUBSTITUTE CHECK
Bear standard MICR line, per
ANS X9.100-140
Conform with ANS X9.100-
140 standard for substitute
checks
Be suitable for automated
processing
In addition, the substitute check must:
▪ Bear a MICR line containing all the information from the
original check’s MICR line, except as provided in ANS
X9.100-140 to facilitate the processing of substitute
checks;
▪ Conform in paper stock, dimension, and otherwise with the
industry standard for substitute checks; and
▪ Be suitable for automated processing, just like the original
check.
14.
Legal Equivalent
All front and back information
on original check:
– Payment
– Identification
– Indorsement information
Legal equivalence legend
Bank warranties
The regulation provides that a properly prepared substitute
check is the legal equivalent of the original check if it:
▪ Accurately represents all of the information on the front
and back of the original check, including payment, identification, and indorsement information;
▪ Bears the Check 21 Act’s required legal equivalence
legend that reads, “This is a legal copy of your check. You
can use it the same way you would use the original
check.”; and
▪ Has been warranted by a bank, according to the Check 21
Act warranty requirements with respect to the substitute
check.
A legally equivalent substitute check can be used in place
of an original check, wherever the original check is required.
15.
Payments System The interdependent nature of the payments system virtually guarantees that every financial institution will at least
receive substitute checks. Therefore, financial institutions
should understand and be prepared to comply with the
relevant aspects of the Check 21 requirements.
Let’s look at just which institutions are subject to Check 21
requirements.
16.
"Bank"
Insured banks
Mutual savings banks
Savings banks
Insured credit unions
Savings associations
Agency/branches of foreign banks
Federal Home Loan Bank members
The regulation creates a unique definition of bank to
include insured banks, mutual savings banks, savings
banks, insured credit unions, savings associations, an
agency or a branch of a foreign banks, and members of a
Federal Home Loan Bank.
Page 5
17.
"Bank"
Federal Reserve Bank
Federal Home Loan Bank
US Treasury
US Postal Service
Person engaged in the
business of banking…
The definition also includes any person engaged in the
business of banking, such as a Federal Reserve Bank or a
Federal Home Loan Bank, and, to the extent that they act
as a paying bank, the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Postal
Service. And, that's the way we'll use the term bank in the
remainder of the presentation.
There are also a couple of other unique definitions that
you'll need to know as you view the remainder of the
modules.
18.
Definitions
Banks
Truncate
Truncating bank
Reconverting Bank
The regulation uses the term "truncate" to mean removing
an original check from the check collection process and
replacing it with information from the original check, including MICR line data, whether with or without the subsequent delivery of the original check.
The bank that's responsible for truncation of the original
check is called the "truncating bank.”
A "reconverting bank” is defined as the bank that creates a
substitute check or, if a person other than a bank creates
a substitute check, the first bank to transfer, present, or
return a substitute check, or a paper or electronic representation of a substitute check.
19.
Reconverting Bank Responsibilities
Losses associated with
substitute checks
Certain established
requirements
The Check 21 Act is designed so that losses associated
with a substitute check are borne by the reconverting
bank. Therefore, there are certain requirements established for these banks.
20.
Identify itself as reconverting
bank on substitute check
Preserve all reconverting bank
identifications
Ensure substitute check bears
all previously applied
indorsements
Identify bank that truncated
original check
Reconverting Bank Responsibilities
Each reconverting bank must:
▪ Identify itself as a reconverting bank on the substitute
check;
▪ Preserve all previous reconverting bank identifications;
▪ Ensure that the substitute check bears all previously
applied indorsements; and
▪ Identify the bank that truncated the original check.
Page 6
21.
Warranties
Legal equivalence warranty
Duplicative payment warranty
The law also stipulates that a bank that transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check makes two warranties
under the Act:
▪ A legal equivalence warranty—the substitute check meets
the requirements for legal equivalence; and
▪ A duplicative payment warranty—no bank, drawee,
drawer, or indorser will be asked to make a payment on a
check it already has paid.
22.
Warranties
Paying Customer
Bank
Reconverting
Bank
Warranties
Substitute

Substitute
Check
Both warranties apply to substitute checks and paper or
electronic representations of substitute checks. Whenever
a bank transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check
for which it receives consideration, the bank is automatically making these two warranties. These warranties can
also flow back to the first reconverting bank.
23.
Indemnity
For losses suffered from
receiving substitute check
instead of original
check
Banks that transfer, present, or return a substitute check,
or a paper or electronic representation of a substitute
check, also indemnify subsequent parties against losses
due to the receipt of a substitute check in place of the
original check. A valid indemnity claim can only be made
by a recipient of a substitute check.
As with the warranties, the indemnities also flow back to
the first reconverting bank.
24.
Modules
Overview of the Act and
Final Regulation
Check Clearing Under
Check 21
Now that you have a general background of the provisions,
let's see how the check clearing might work under Check
21.
Page 7
25. Module 2: Check Clearing Under Check 21
26.
Check 21 Clearing Process
Check BOFD
Bank A
Bank B
Check
Image
As with all checks, the Check 21 clearing process starts
with a person writing an original check.
The payee then deposits the check with the Bank of First
Deposit or BOFD, which we will call Bank A. Bank A then
stamps its indorsement onto the back of the original
check.
Let's assume that Bank A decides to “truncate” the original
check and send electronic information about the check to
Bank B; therefore, Bank A is the “truncating bank.”
Of course, in order for this scenario to occur, Bank B must
have previously agreed to accept checks electronically
from Bank A.
27.
Truncating Process In order to truncate the original check, Bank A:
28.
Truncating Process
Captures front and back of
the original check
Captures the MICR
Sends the image/MICR line
data to Bank B
"Correspondent Bank"
▪ Captures an image of the front and back of the original
check;
▪ Captures the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR)
line data from the original check; and
▪ Sends the image and MICR line data in lieu of the original
check to Bank B, its correspondent bank.

29.
Check 21 Clearing Process

Bank B applies its indorsement electronically and transfers
the check image and MICR line data to Bank C. Again, in
order for this scenario to occur, Bank C must have previously agreed to accept checks electronically from Bank B.
30.
Check 21 Clearing Process

Bank B Bank C Bank D
Bank C wants to present the check for payment to Bank D,
the paying bank. However, Bank D has not agreed to
accept checks electronically.
Accordingly, Bank C uses the information received from
Bank B to create a substitute check, and therefore becomes the reconverting bank.
Finally, Bank C presents the substitute check to Bank D
for payment.
Bank D, the Paying Bank, uses the MICR line data on the
substitute check to process it just like an original check.
31.

Bank D may provide the substitute check to its customer,
who wrote the original check, in the customer’s monthly
periodic statement.

Consumer Compliance
Issues
Module 3: Consumer Compliance Issues
35.
Consumer Awareness Banks that provide their consumer customers with cancelled checks in periodic statements need to comply with a
requirement to provide a disclosure of consumer rights
under the new law.
36.
Consumer Disclosures
Provide existing consumer
customers disclosure by first
statement after October 28, 2004
Provide new consumer
customers a disclosure when
relationship is established
Provide disclosure to
consumers who occasionally
receive substitute checks
Check 21 requires banks to provide this disclosure in a
number of circumstances.
▪ All existing consumer customers who routinely receive
cancelled checks in their periodic statement must be provided a disclosure no later than the first statement after
October 28, 2004.
▪ All new consumer customers who will receive cancelled
checks or substitute checks must be provided a disclosure
when the customer relationship is established.
▪ Consumers who receive substitute checks on an occasional basis must also be provided the disclosure.
Page 10
37.
Consumer Request For Copy If a bank provides a substitute check in response to a
consumer’s request for a copy of a check, the bank must
provide the disclosure at the time of the request, if feasible, and, otherwise, no later than when the bank provides
the substitute check.
38.
Timing Of Disclosures If a bank provides a consumer a returned substitute check,
the consumer disclosure must be provided at the time the
bank provides the substitute check. A bank must provide
the disclosure on these occasional bases even if the
consumer previously received the disclosure.

Model Language Model language for the disclosure is found in Appendix C

provides a safe harbor for content requirements. Of
course the bank’s policies and practices must be consistent with the disclosure.
Legal Requirements
Consumer Awareness
Check 21's Consumer
Expedited Recredit Rights
Consumer Awareness is only one of the compliance requirements set out in the law and regulation. A bank that
provides a substitute check to a consumer also must be
prepared to comply with Check 21's Consumer Expedited
Recredit Rights for addressing errors relating to substitute
checks.
Page 11
41.
Expedited Recredit Rights
Applies only to “consumers”
not business customers
Applies only to substitute
checks charged to
consumer deposit
accounts
Expedited recredit rights may apply when a bank provides
a substitute check to a consumer.
The provision applies only to “consumers,” not business
customers, who have received a substitute check and
have had a transaction involving a substitute check
charged to their account.
Because the Check 21 Act defines “account” as a deposit
account, the expedited recredit procedures only apply to
substitute checks charged to a consumer deposit account.
42.
Not A Trigger
Credit card checks
Checks drawn on home
equity line of credit
Checks drawn on a brokerage
clearing account
Generally, credit card checks, checks a consumer draws
on a home equity line of credit, or checks a consumer
draws on a brokerage clearing account would not trigger
the expedited recredit rights.
43.
Use Of Expedited Recredit
Account charged for substitute
check
Account improperly charged
or warranty claim
Consumer suffered loss
Original check or copy needed
to determine claim validity
To use the expedited recredit process, the consumer must
be able to assert in good faith that:
▪ The consumer’s account was charged for a substitute
check that the consumer received;
▪ The consumer’s account was improperly charged or the
consumer has a warranty claim related to the substitute
check;
▪ The consumer suffered a loss; and
▪ The consumer needs the original check or a “sufficient
copy” to determine the validity of the claim.
44.
Consumer Must Provide
Description of situation
Statement of loss and
estimate
Necessity of original check or
sufficient copy
Sufficient identification
information
In addition, the consumer must provide:
▪ A description of why he or she believes the account was
improperly charged or the nature of the warranty claim;
▪ A statement that a loss occurred, including an estimate of
the amount;
▪ The reason why producing the original check or a sufficient
copy is necessary to determine the validity of the charge;
and
▪ Sufficient information to identify the substitute check and
to investigate the claim.
Page 12
45.
Loss And Recredits
Breach of substitute check
warranty or indemnity
– Damages up to the amount of
substitute check
– Interest and expenses
Both breach of warranty and
indemnity
– Damages up to amount of the
substitute check
– Interest and expenses
– Other proximately caused damages
In determining the amount of loss and related recredits a
bank must consider:
▪ If the loss only involved a breach of the substitute check
warranty, or only involved the indemnity, the claimant is
entitled to damages up to the amount of the substitute
check, plus interest and expenses, such as reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses of representation.
▪ If the loss involves both a breach of warranty claim and an
indemnity claim, the claimant is entitled to damages up to
the amount of the substitute check, plus interest and expenses, as well as other proximately caused damages.
46.
Time Limitations
Bank receipt within 40 calendar
days of bank mailing the:
– Account statement
– Substitute check
Required Extensions
A consumer must file an expedited recredit claim so that
the bank receives it within 40 calendar days from the date
that the bank mailed, or delivered by a means agreed to
by the consumer, the:
▪ Account statement showing the transaction that gave rise
to the claim or
▪ Substitute check that gave rise to the claim,
whichever date is later.
Banks are required to extend the time limits in extenuating
circumstances, and have latitude under the final rules to
extend the 40-day time period for any reason. A bank may
choose to extend the 40-day time period, so that it parallels the 60-day claim period under Regulation E, which
involves claims for disputed electronic fund transfers.
47.
Claim Versus Complaint A complaint is not a “claim,” for purposes of the expedited
recredit procedure, until the claim is complete; and the
bank’s “clock” for responding does not begin to tick until
the consumer submits a complete claim. However, the
bank has a duty to tell the consumer that the complaint is
incomplete and must identify what information is missing.
Page 13
48.
If bank requires written claim…
Bank must:
– Inform consumer of requirement
– Include requirement in consumer
awareness disclosure
Consumer must submit for
receipt within:
– Within 10 business days of
notification of requirement or
– Within standard 40-calendar-day
requirement
Other bank requirements concerning Consumer Expedited
Recredit Rights include requirements for claims:
▪ If a bank requires a written claim and the consumer attempts to submit a claim orally, the bank must inform the
consumer of the requirement for a written claim at the time
the consumer attempts an oral claim. The consumer
awareness disclosure that the bank distributes also should
inform the consumer of the written claim requirement.
▪ If the bank requires the claim to be in writing, the consumer must submit the written claim so that the bank receives it either
־ Within 10 business days of the date of notification of the
written claim requirement or
־ Within the basic 40-calendar-day time period, previously
discussed, for filing a claim
whichever is later.
If an oral claim is made within the 40-day period and the
consumer meets the 10-day written notification requirement, the consumer’s claim is timely even if the written
claim is received after the basic 40-day period.
49.
Response Options Banks have certain options for responding to consumer
claims. If an expedited recredit claim is received, the bank
must take one of three options.
50.
Response Options
Notice of recredit – business day
after banking day of recredit to
consumer account; or
Deny claim - business day after
banking day on which determination
is made; or
Provisionally recredit consumer
account - 10th business day after
banking day of receipt of claim
It must:
▪ Send a notice of recredit no later than the business day
after the banking day on which the bank recredits the consumer’s account; or
▪ Deny the claim and demonstrate to the consumer why the
claim is not valid—no later than the business day after the
banking day on which it makes this determination; or
▪ If the bank has not determined the validity of the claim by
the 10th business day after the banking day on which the
bank received the claim, the bank must provisionally
recredit a consumer’s account pending further investigation.
The bank must provide a notice of the provisional
recredit no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank recredits the consumer’s
account.
Page 14
51.
Provisional Recredits
Recredit amount of loss - up
to amount of the substitute
check or $2,500
Recredit remaining amount -
by 45th calendar day after
receiving claim
May reverse recredit
If the bank provisionally recredits a consumer’s account
pending further investigation, the bank is required to
recredit the amount of the consumer’s loss, up to the
amount of the substitute check or $2,500, whichever is
less. The bank would recredit any remaining amount (plus
applicable interest) on the 45th calendar day after receiving the claim, unless before that time the bank had already
made a determination concerning either the validity or
invalidity of the consumer’s claim.
If the bank later determines that the claim was not valid,
the bank may reverse the recredit. The bank must provide
a notice of reversal of recredit no later than the business
day after the banking day on which the bank makes the
reversal.
52.
Expedited Recredit Notices
Model Notice
The Federal Reserve Board has provided model notices in
appendix C that banks may use in responding to consumer
expedited recredit claims. Unlike the model consumer
awareness disclosure, however, use of these model notices does not provide banks with a safe harbor.
53.
Interbank Expedited Recredit
Recover losses associated
with consumer expedited
recredit claim
Claimant bank
– Within 120 calendar days
Indemnifying bank
– Within 10 days after receipt of
the claim
The law also gives banks certain Interbank Expedited
Recredit Rights that allow a bank to recover losses associated with a consumer expedited recredit claim from the
indemnifying bank that sent the item in question.
The claimant bank can submit a claim to cover losses
associated with providing an expedited recredit to a consumer or another bank involved in the collection process.
This claim must be submitted by close-of-business on the
120th calendar day after the claimant bank processed the
problematic substitute check. And the indemnifying bank
has 10 days after receipt of the claim to provide a recredit,
the original check, or a sufficient copy. These provisions
can be varied by agreement.

Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act
Foundation for Check 21 Compliance Training
BACKGROUND
The economics of the check business is changing. Declining check volumes and a largely fixed-cost-based check processing infrastructure have caused banks’ unit costs for processing paper checks to rise. Accordingly, many banks have begun to seek less costly alternatives to sorting paper checks and transporting them physically around the country on a daily basis. For example, some banks have begun to exchange electronic images of checks. However, under current check law, a bank must present the original paper check for payment unless the paying bank has agreed to accept electronic presentment. Because of the large number of banks and the unwillingness of some paying banks to receive checks electronically, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a bank to obtain electronic presentment agreements with all other banks. As a result, banks that want to engage in electronic check exchange on a widespread basis have been hampered in their ability to do so.

The banking industry and consumer groups therefore worked with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board), and later with Congress, to develop legislation that would facilitate the ability of banks to exchange checks electronically without requiring any bank to change its check processing methods. This legislation, known as the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21 Act or Check 21 or the Act), was enacted on October 28, 2003, and becomes effective on October 28, 2004. The Check 21 Act authorizes a new negotiable instrument called a “substitute check,” which is a paper reproduction of an original check, and provides that a properly prepared substitute check is the legal equivalent of an original check. The Act facilitates electronic check exchange by enabling banks to sort and deliver checks electronically and, where necessary, to create legally equivalent substitute checks for presentment to banks that have not agreed to accept checks electronically.

INTRODUCTION
It is likely that most financial institutions will, at some point in time, receive a substitute check that is subject to the Check 21 Act and subpart D of the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation CC, which implements the Check 21 Act. This is true whether or not a financial institution chooses to create substitute checks. Some financial institutions will rapidly migrate toward electronic check exchange. Others will proceed more hesitantly. Regardless, all banks must be prepared to accept a substitute check in place of the original after the Act’s effective date of October 28, 2004. Because the Check 21 Act provides that a properly prepared substitute check is the “legal equivalent of the original check for all purposes,” a bank cannot refuse to pay a check based solely on the fact that it was presented with a substitute check instead of the original check.

One of a bank’s regulatory compliance obligations will be to provide a consumer awareness disclosure to consumer customers who receive canceled checks with their periodic account statements or who otherwise receive substitute checks on an occasional basis. A bank that provides a substitute check to a consumer also must be prepared to comply with the Check 21 Act’s expedited recredit procedure for addressing errors relating to substitute checks. Even if the customer does not receive actual canceled checks in a monthly statement, but instead receives a truncated summary, the individual may eventually receive a substitute check, either in response to a request for a check or a copy of a check or because a check that the consumer deposited was returned unpaid to the consumer in the form of a substitute check. Some increase in the potential for duplicate posting (substitute check and original) may also involve a degree of consumer education and explanation. The regulation provides safe-harbor language for the consumer awareness disclosure and specifies when it must be distributed. 

The Act
The Check 21 Act, Pub. L. No. 108-100, 117 Stat.1177, codified at 12 U.S.C. §§ 5001-5018, was signed into law on October 28, 2003, and will take effect on October 28, 2004. The Check 21 Act facilitates check truncation and electronic check exchange by authorizing a new negotiable instrument called a “substitute check.”

The Act provides that a substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check if (1) it accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time it was truncated (including payment, identification, and indorsement information), (2) it bears the legend: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check,” and (3) a bank has made the Check 21 Act warranties with respect to the substitute check. A bank does not need to affirmatively state that it is making the Check 21 Act warranties; rather, a bank automatically makes the Check 21 Act warranties when it transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check for which it receives consideration. 

The Check 21 Act defines “bank” to include insured banks, savings banks, credit unions, savings associations, and anyone else engaged in the business of banking. The U.S.Treasury and the U.S. Postal Service also are banks for purposes of the Check 21 Act to the extent that they are payors of a check (the term check includes U.S. Postal Service money orders). The Act defines a “reconverting bank” as the bank that creates a substitute check or, if a person other than a bank creates a substitute check, the first bank to transfer, present, or return, a substitute check (or, in lieu thereof, the first paper or electronic representation of the substitute check) to another party.

Although the Check 21 Act does not require any bank to create substitute checks or to accept checks electronically, certain provisions of the Check 21 Act will affect all banks, even if they choose not to create substitute checks. These provisions involve consumer awareness disclosures, new warranties and an indemnity, and expedited recredit procedures to protect consumer substitute check recipients.

The Final Regulation
On July 26, 2004, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System released its final rule amending Regulation CC (Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks) to implement the Check 21 Act. These amendments detail the requirements of the Check 21 Act that apply to banks, provide a model consumer awareness disclosure and other model notices for educating consumer customers about their rights under the Act, and specify bank indorsement and identification requirements for substitute checks. The final regulations also clarify some existing provisions of the rule and commentary. The final regulations can be found at:

http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2004/20040726/default.htm

THE SUBSTITUTE CHECK CLEARING PROCESS
Check 21 enables banks to clear checks electronically without having pre-existing agreements between the bank of first deposit and the paying bank. Below is an example of the steps that may be involved in the substitute check clearing process:

Step 1
A customer indorses an original check and deposits it with Bank 1, the Bank of First Deposit (BOFD). Bank 1 stamps its indorsement onto the back of the original check.

Step 2
Bank 1 decides to “truncate” the original check and is, therefore, the “truncating bank”[1] Bank 1, therefore, (1) captures an image of the front and back of the original check, (2) captures the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line data from the original check, and (3) sends to Bank 2, its correspondent bank, the image and MICR line data in lieu of the original check. Bank 1 also identifies itself as the truncating bank in the electronic records it sends to Bank 2. Note that in order for this scenario to occur, Bank 2 must have previously agreed to accept checks electronically from Bank 1. If Bank 2 had not so agreed, then Bank 1 would need to provide either the original check or a legally equivalent substitute check to Bank 2.

Step 3
Bank 2 applies its indorsement electronically and transfers the check image and MICR line data to Bank 3. Again, in order for this scenario to occur, Bank 3 must have previously agreed to accept checks electronically from Bank 2.

Step 4
Bank 3 desires to present the check for payment to Bank 4, the paying bank, but Bank 4 has not agreed to accept checks electronically. Accordingly, Bank 3 uses the information received from Bank 2 to create a substitute check, and Bank 3 is, therefore, the reconverting bank. As part of the substitute check creation process, Bank 3 (1) includes the image of the front of the original check on the front of the substitute check, (2) includes the image of the back of the original check on the back of the substitute check, and (3) applies the MICR line data from the original check to the bottom of the front of the substitute check. Additionally, Bank 3 overlays its own indorsement and the indorsement of Bank 2 onto the back of the substitute check at the time it creates the substitute check. (Bank 1’s indorsement, along with Bank 1’s depositor’s indorsement, is contained within the image of the back of the original check that Bank 3 applies to the back of the substitute check.) Bank 3 also identifies itself as the reconverting bank on the front and back of the substitute check and identifies Bank 1 as the truncating bank on the front of the substitute check. Bank 3 presents the substitute check to Bank 4, the paying bank, for payment.

Step 5
Bank 4, the paying bank, uses the MICR line data that Bank 3 applied to the bottom of the substitute check to process the substitute check in the same manner as it would have processed the original check. Bank 4 may provide the substitute check to its customer (who wrote the original check) in the customer’s monthly periodic statement. 

If there had been insufficient funds to cover this substitute check, the paying bank could return it stamped NSF to Bank 1, the Bank of First Deposit. Regulation CC requires the reason for return to be stamped on the portion of the substitute check that contains the image of the original check. Bank 1 could then charge its customer’s account for the returned item and provide the substitute check with the chargeback notice.

UNIQUE CHECK 21 CONCEPTS
What is a substitute check? [Section 229.2(2)(aaa)]

A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that:

Contains an image of the front and back of the original check;
 Bears a MICR line containing all the information from the original check’s MICR line, except as provided in ANS X9.100-140, to facilitate the processing of substitute checks;[2]
Conforms in paper stock, dimension, and otherwise with the industry standard for substitute checks, ANS X9.100-140; and 
Is suitable for automated processing just like the original check.
When is a substitute check the legal equivalent of the original check?

A substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check if:

It accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time the original check was truncated;
It bears the Check 21 Act’s required legal equivalence legend:
“This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check;” and
 A bank has made the Check 21 Act warranties with respect to the substitute check.
What is included in “all of the information” on the front and back of the original check?

“All of the information” includes the information from the original check that must be present on the substitute check in order for the substitute check to meet the Uniform Commercial Code’s (UCC) requirements for a negotiable instrument. This information includes the payment and indorsement information from the original check. A substitute check need not contain watermarks, decorative features, or security features that do not survive the imaging process.

One important point to remember is that substitute checks are checks and are, therefore, subject to existing check law, such as articles 3 and 4 of the UCC. 

Substitute Check Warranties [Section 229.52]
Legal equivalence warranty [Section 229.52 (a)]

Beginning with the first reconverting bank in the check clearing process, any bank that transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of the operative substitute check, warrants to all subsequent transferees that the substitute check being transferred (or the substitute check from which the paper or electronic representation being transferred was derived) meets the requirements for legal equivalence.

Duplicative payment warranty [Section 229.52 (a) (2)]

The reconverting bank also warrants that no depositary bank, drawee, drawer, or indorser will be asked to make a payment based on a check it already has paid. A “check” includes any of the following items: a substitute check, the original check, or a paper or electronic representation of the substitute check or the original check.

Substitute Check Indemnity [Section 229.53]
Any bank that transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check or paper or electronic representation of a substitute check must indemnify the initial recipient and any subsequent recipient for losses suffered by the recipient because of receiving a substitute check instead of the original check.

An indemnity claim can be originated only by a recipient of a substitute check. By contrast, a recipient of a substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of a substitute check can originate a warranty claim. 

Calculating recoverable losses

If the loss only involves a breach of the substitute check warranty, or only involves the indemnity, the claimant is entitled to damages up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest and expenses (i.e., reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses of representation). 

If the loss involves both a breach of warranty claim and an indemnity claim, the claimant is entitled to damages up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest and expenses, as well as other proximately caused damages. 

Another point to remember is that electronic check conversion (i.e., where information from a check is used to create an automated clearinghouse (ACH) debit) is similar to but separate from the check substitution process authorized by the Check 21 Act. The ACH electronic fund transfers between financial institutions are not considered check transactions and thus are not subject to check law. Rather, they are governed by the rule of the automated clearinghouse that processes the electronic fund transfer. ACH transactions to or from consumer accounts also are subject to the provisions of the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation E.

The Check 21 Act has implications for consumers and compliance considerations for insured institutions and regulators.

CONSUMER PROTECTION PROVISIONS
Consumer awareness disclosure [Section 229.57]
What is required?

The Check 21 Act requires banks to provide certain consumer customers with a disclosure that describes substitute checks and the rights consumers have when they receive substitute checks. The disclosure must describe 1) how substitute checks are the legal equivalent of original checks and 2) the Check 21 Act’s consumer expedited recredit procedures.

A bank that uses the consumer awareness disclosure language contained in model form C-5A in appendix C of Regulation CC is deemed to have complied with the content requirement(s) for which it used the model language, provided that the model language that the bank uses accurately describes the bank’s policies and practices. 

Which consumer customers must receive the disclosure?

A consumer customer is a natural person who deposits a check into, cashes a check against, or draws a check on a deposit account that he or she uses primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.

Disclosure to consumer customers who receive paid checks with periodic account statements

A bank must provide the disclosure to a consumer customer who receives paid checks (which could include paid original checks and/or paid substitute checks) with his or her periodic account statement (1) no later than the bank’s first statement cycle after October 28, 2004, for each consumer who is a customer of the bank on that date; and (2) at the time the customer relationship is initiated, for each customer relationship established after that date.

Disclosure to consumers who receive substitute checks only on an occasional basis

If a bank provides a substitute check in response to a consumer’s request for a copy of a check, the bank must provide the disclosure at the time of the request, if feasible, and, otherwise, no later than when the bank provides the substitute check. If a bank provides a consumer a returned substitute check, the consumer disclosure must be provided at the time the bank provides the substitute check. A bank must provide the disclosure on these occasional bases even if the consumer previously received the disclosure (for example, because the consumer is a customer who receives paid checks with his or her monthly account statement). 

Consumer expedited recredit rights [Section 229.54] 
The consumer expedited recredit provision only applies to “consumers” (not business customers) who have received a substitute check and have had a transaction involving a substitute check charged to their account. Because the Check 21 Act defines “account” as a deposit account, the expedited recredit procedures only apply to substitute checks charged to a consumer deposit account. Credit card checks, checks a consumer draws on a home equity line of credit, or checks a consumer draws on a brokerage clearing account would, therefore, generally not trigger the expedited recredit procedures. Such checks could only trigger the expedited recredit procedures if a consumer had deposited such a check into his or her deposit account, the check were returned unpaid, and the bank provided the returned check to the consumer depositor in the form of a substitute check. Note: The UCC provisions that prohibit a bank from making unauthorized charges to the consumer’s account still apply regardless of whether the expedited recredit procedure applies.

To use the expedited recredit procedure, the consumer must be able to assert in good faith that the:

Consumer’s account was charged for a substitute check;
Consumer’s account was improperly charged or the consumer has a warranty claim related to the substitute check;
Consumer suffered a loss; and
Consumer needs the original check or a “sufficient copy” to determine the validity of the claim.
A “sufficient copy” is defined in Section 229.2 (bbb) as “a copy of an original check that accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time the original check was truncated or is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not a claim is valid.” 

How does a consumer file an expedited recredit claim?

A consumer must file an expedited recredit claim so that the bank receives it within 40 calendar days from the later of the date that the bank mailed, or delivered by a means agreed to by the consumer, (1) the account statement showing the transaction that gave rise to the claim or (2) the substitute check that gave rise to the claim. (The bank is required to extend the time for making a claim in extenuating circumstances. Additionally, the bank also has the latitude under the final rules to extend the 40-day time period for consumer action, so that it can parallel the 60-day claim period under Regulation E involving claims for disputed electronic fund transfers). 

To make a claim for expedited recredit, a consumer must provide:

A description of why the consumer believes the account was improperly charged or the nature of the consumer’s warranty claim;
A statement that a loss occurred, including an estimate of the amount;
The reason why producing the original check or a sufficient copy is necessary to determine the validity of the charge; and
Sufficient information to identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim.
Other requirements
The bank has a duty to inform the consumer whether his or her complaint is incomplete (and thus is not yet a “claim” for purposes of the expedited recredit procedure) and must identify what information is missing. A bank’s “clock” for responding does not begin to tick until the consumer submits a complete claim.

If a bank requires a written claim and the consumer attempts to submit a claim orally, the bank must, at the time of the attempted oral claim submission, inform the consumer of the written claim submission requirement. The consumer awareness disclosure that the bank distributes also should inform the consumer of the written claim requirement.

If the bank requires the claim to be in writing, the consumer must submit the written claim so that the bank receives it either (1) within 10 business days of the date of notification of the written claim requirement, or (2) within the “basic” 40-calendar-day time period (discussed above) for filing a claim, whichever is later.

If an oral claim is made within the 40-day period and the consumer meets the 10 day written notification requirement, the consumer’s claim is timely even if the written claim is received after the “basic” 40-day period.

Bank options for responding to consumer claims
A bank that receives an expedited recredit claim must take one of the following actions:

Approve the claim and provide a full recredit no later than the business day after making that determination. In this case, the bank must send a notice of recredit no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank recredits the consumer’s account;
Deny the claim and demonstrate to the consumer why the claim is not valid. The bank must send a notice demonstrating that the consumer’s claim is not valid no later than the business day after the banking day on which it makes this determination; or
If the bank has not taken an action described in (1) or (2) by the tenth business day after the banking day on which the bank received the claim, the bank must provisionally recredit a consumer’s account pending further investigation. The bank must provide notice of the provisional recredit no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank recredits the consumer’s account.
If the bank provisionally recredits a consumer’s account pending further investigation, the bank is required to recredit the amount of the consumer’s loss, up to the amount of the substitute check or $2,500, whichever is less. The bank must also recredit interest on that amount if the consumer’s account is an interest-bearing account. The bank would recredit any remaining amount (plus applicable interest) on the 45th calendar day after receiving the claim, unless before that time the bank had already made a determination concerning either the validity or invalidity of the consumer’s claim.

If the bank later determines that the claim was not valid, the bank may reverse the recredit (notwithstanding whether the bank’s recredit to the consumer’s account was provided under (1) or (3) above). The bank must provide a notice of reversal of recredit no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank makes the reversal.

The Federal Reserve Board has provided model notices in appendix C that banks may use in responding to consumer expedited recredit claims under §229.54(e). Unlike the model consumer awareness disclosure form C-5A, however, use of these model notices does not provide banks with a statutory safe harbor. 

COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS FOR BANKS
A bank is not required to create substitute checks or to accept checks electronically. However, on October 28, 2004, a bank, at a minimum, should be prepared to receive a substitute check in place of an original check. Banks that choose to create substitute checks will take on additional duties with respect to the substitute check.

Duties for all banks
All banks that transfer, present, or return a substitute check for consideration thereby make the substitute check warranties and indemnities described in Regulation CC. However, in the vast majority of cases, liability for the warranties and indemnity ultimately will flow back to the reconverting bank.

Because a substitute check must be suitable for automated processing in the same manner as an original check, a bank that receives a substitute check will not need to change its equipment and will need to make only minor processing changes if it returns a substitute check.

A bank that returns a substitute check must place the reason for return within the portion of the substitute check that contains the image of the original check; and a bank that qualifies a substitute check for return must encode position 44 of the return MICR line with a “5” instead of a “2.”

Duties of the reconverting bank [Section 229.51]
The Check 21 Act is designed so that losses associated with a substitute check are borne by the reconverting bank.

A reconverting bank is defined in the Check 21 Act as the bank that creates a substitute check; or, if the substitute check is created by a nonbank, the first bank that transfers or presents the substitute check (or in lieu thereof the first paper or electronic representation of that substitute check).

The reconverting bank must:

Identify itself as a reconverting bank on the substitute check;
Preserve all previous reconverting bank identifications;
Ensure that the substitute check bears all previously applied indorsements; and
Identify the bank that truncated the original check.
Pursuant to the Check 21 Act, the reconverting bank and each bank that subsequently transfers, presents, or returns the substitute check for consideration makes two warranties:

First, that the substitute check meets the legal equivalence requirements (See above for what these legal equivalence requirements are.), and
Second, that a paying bank will not be asked to make payment on an item that it has already paid.
Note that the reconverting bank is responsible for the legal equivalence warranty even if a substitute check’s failure to accurately represent the payment information from the original check is the result of the drawer using an ink type or color that does not survive the image capturing process or is the result of receiving a poor image file from an electronic sender. However, a reconverting bank can attempt to further allocate warranty losses by agreement.

Note that the responsibility of the reconverting bank for the duplicative payment warranty and for the indemnity does not depend upon knowledge or fault. Also note that the duplicative payment warranty applies only to charges initiated by check, as opposed to ACH debits. 

Interbank expedited recredit rights [Section 229.55]
Interbank expedited recredit rights allow a bank to recover losses associated with a consumer expedited recredit claim from the indemnifying bank that sent the item in question. 

The claimant bank can submit a claim to cover losses associated with providing an expedited recredit to a consumer or another bank involved in the collection process. This claim must be submitted by close-of-business on the 120th calendar day after the claimant bank processed the substitute check in question. 

The indemnifying bank has 10 days after receipt of the claim to provide: 1) a recredit; 2) the original check, or 3) a “sufficient copy.” 

CHECK 21 EXAMINATIONS – COMPLIANCE
In evaluating a financial institution’s compliance with the Check 21 provisions of Regulation CC, examiners should generally focus their evaluation on meeting two objectives:

Determining the financial institution’s compliance with subpart D notice content and timing requirements (general consumer awareness disclosures regarding substitute checks and notices that respond to a consumer’s expedited recredit claim regarding a substitute check error), and
Ascertaining whether the financial institution complies with timing requirements for acting on a substitute check expedited recredit claim.
Preliminary review of documents that demonstrate the financial institution’s compliance with the notice requirements can include, but are not limited to:

Consumer awareness notice(s)
Sample (test) substitute checks, if available
Direct mail correspondence, statement stuffers, et. al. describing Check 21/substitute check implementation to consumer customers
Notices relating to expedited recredit claims:
Notice of valid claim and refund
Notice of provisional refund
Denial of claim
Reversal of refund
Review of the financial institution’s training manual, procedures manual, internal audit reports, and board meeting minutes can reveal the extent to which the financial institution’s compliance risk management program has responded to the Check 21 provisions. Additionally, interviews with key staff members, including new accounts personnel and deposit operations, can identify how effectively the institution’s management has communicated its response to this new regulation to the individuals responsible for ensuring compliance.

The FFIEC has approved examination procedures that discuss the steps examiners should follow to evaluate a financial institution’s effective use of the consumer awareness notice and handling of any consumer claims of Check 21-related losses. Those examination procedures can be found on the Examination Procedures link above. 

CONCLUSION
As we wrap up our Check 21 training, the most important learning you need to come away with is fairly simple. 

Check 21 Does Not
Require banks to accept check images (image exchange must still take place under agreements)
Give legal equivalence to check images
Mandate check truncation
Mandate destruction of original checks
Exclude business or U.S. Treasury checks
Pertain to checks that are converted to ACH transactions
Check 21 Does
Create a new negotiable instrument (called a substitute check)
Provide that a properly prepared substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check
Provide that any check is eligible to become a substitute check
Require banks to accept legally equivalent substitute checks
The Law – Check 21 Act
Authorizes substitute checks and defines the look, format and other features

No person or entity is required to issue a substitute check. However, a properly prepared substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check. Therefore, a paying bank must receive a legally equivalent substitute check just as it would the original check.

Protects recipients of substitute checks

Warranties and Indemnity
Two warranties
Legal equivalence warranty 
No double debit warranty
Indemnity against losses due to the receipt of a substitute check in lieu of the original check
Expedited recredit for consumers
Expedited recredit for banks
Requires consumer awareness

All existing consumer customers who routinely receive canceled checks in their periodic statement must be provided a disclosure no later than the first statement after October 28, 2004.

After that date, all new consumer customers who receive canceled checks or substitute checks must be provided a disclosure when the new account is opened.

This disclosure must:

Explain that a substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check, and
Describe the consumer’s rights for recredit for substitute checks not properly charged to the consumer’s account.
Model disclosure for banks to use – Appendix C, form C-5A of Regulation CC.

Consumers who receive substitute checks on an occasional basis (e.g., consumers who request a copy of a check and receive a substitute check or who receive, in the form of a substitute check, a previously deposited item that has been returned unpaid) must also be provided the disclosure.

When the consumer contacts the bank to request a copy of a check (where possible), the bank should provide the model disclosure at the time of the request.
If that is not feasible, the disclosure should be provided no later than when the substitute check is provided.
When a substitute check is provided as a returned deposited item, the disclosure should be included along with the substitute check. 
This concludes our Check 21 training. Please visit our Resources page located above on this FFIEC Web site. You will also find other Web links and additional information there.

 

Footnotes
[1]Under § 229.2(ddd), “truncate means to remove an original check from the forward collection or return process and send to a recipient, in lieu of such original check, a substitute check, or, by agreement, information relating to the original check (including data taken from the MICR line of the original check or an electronic image of the original check), whether with or without the subsequent delivery of the original check. Under § 229.2(eee), a “truncating bank” is defined as follows: “(1) The bank that truncates the original check; or (2) If a person other than a bank truncates the original check, the first bank that transfers, presents, or returns, in lieu of such original check, a substitute check or, by agreement with the recipient, information relating to the original check (including data taken from the MICR line of the original check or an electronic image of the original check), whether with or without the subsequent delivery of the original check.”

Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act: Foundation for Check 21 Compliance Training
Public Law 108-100
Final Rule-Regulation CC

Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act
Foundation for Check 21 Compliance Training
BACKGROUND
The economics of the check business is changing. Declining check volumes and a largely fixed-cost-based check processing infrastructure have caused banks’ unit costs for processing paper checks to rise. Accordingly, many banks have begun to seek less costly alternatives to sorting paper checks and transporting them physically around the country on a daily basis. For example, some banks have begun to exchange electronic images of checks. However, under current check law, a bank must present the original paper check for payment unless the paying bank has agreed to accept electronic presentment. Because of the large number of banks and the unwillingness of some paying banks to receive checks electronically, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a bank to obtain electronic presentment agreements with all other banks. As a result, banks that want to engage in electronic check exchange on a widespread basis have been hampered in their ability to do so.

The banking industry and consumer groups therefore worked with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board), and later with Congress, to develop legislation that would facilitate the ability of banks to exchange checks electronically without requiring any bank to change its check processing methods. This legislation, known as the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21 Act or Check 21 or the Act), was enacted on October 28, 2003, and becomes effective on October 28, 2004. The Check 21 Act authorizes a new negotiable instrument called a “substitute check,” which is a paper reproduction of an original check, and provides that a properly prepared substitute check is the legal equivalent of an original check. The Act facilitates electronic check exchange by enabling banks to sort and deliver checks electronically and, where necessary, to create legally equivalent substitute checks for presentment to banks that have not agreed to accept checks electronically.

INTRODUCTION
It is likely that most financial institutions will, at some point in time, receive a substitute check that is subject to the Check 21 Act and subpart D of the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation CC, which implements the Check 21 Act. This is true whether or not a financial institution chooses to create substitute checks. Some financial institutions will rapidly migrate toward electronic check exchange. Others will proceed more hesitantly. Regardless, all banks must be prepared to accept a substitute check in place of the original after the Act’s effective date of October 28, 2004. Because the Check 21 Act provides that a properly prepared substitute check is the “legal equivalent of the original check for all purposes,” a bank cannot refuse to pay a check based solely on the fact that it was presented with a substitute check instead of the original check.

One of a bank’s regulatory compliance obligations will be to provide a consumer awareness disclosure to consumer customers who receive canceled checks with their periodic account statements or who otherwise receive substitute checks on an occasional basis. A bank that provides a substitute check to a consumer also must be prepared to comply with the Check 21 Act’s expedited recredit procedure for addressing errors relating to substitute checks. Even if the customer does not receive actual canceled checks in a monthly statement, but instead receives a truncated summary, the individual may eventually receive a substitute check, either in response to a request for a check or a copy of a check or because a check that the consumer deposited was returned unpaid to the consumer in the form of a substitute check. Some increase in the potential for duplicate posting (substitute check and original) may also involve a degree of consumer education and explanation. The regulation provides safe-harbor language for the consumer awareness disclosure and specifies when it must be distributed.

The Act
The Check 21 Act, Pub. L. No. 108-100, 117 Stat.1177, codified at 12 U.S.C. §§ 5001-5018, was signed into law on October 28, 2003, and will take effect on October 28, 2004. The Check 21 Act facilitates check truncation and electronic check exchange by authorizing a new negotiable instrument called a “substitute check.”

The Act provides that a substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check if (1) it accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time it was truncated (including payment, identification, and indorsement information), (2) it bears the legend: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check,” and (3) a bank has made the Check 21 Act warranties with respect to the substitute check. A bank does not need to affirmatively state that it is making the Check 21 Act warranties; rather, a bank automatically makes the Check 21 Act warranties when it transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check for which it receives consideration.

The Check 21 Act defines “bank” to include insured banks, savings banks, credit unions, savings associations, and anyone else engaged in the business of banking. The U.S.Treasury and the U.S. Postal Service also are banks for purposes of the Check 21 Act to the extent that they are payors of a check (the term check includes U.S. Postal Service money orders). The Act defines a “reconverting bank” as the bank that creates a substitute check or, if a person other than a bank creates a substitute check, the first bank to transfer, present, or return, a substitute check (or, in lieu thereof, the first paper or electronic representation of the substitute check) to another party.

Although the Check 21 Act does not require any bank to create substitute checks or to accept checks electronically, certain provisions of the Check 21 Act will affect all banks, even if they choose not to create substitute checks. These provisions involve consumer awareness disclosures, new warranties and an indemnity, and expedited recredit procedures to protect consumer substitute check recipients.

The Final Regulation
On July 26, 2004, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System released its final rule amending Regulation CC (Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks) to implement the Check 21 Act. These amendments detail the requirements of the Check 21 Act that apply to banks, provide a model consumer awareness disclosure and other model notices for educating consumer customers about their rights under the Act, and specify bank indorsement and identification requirements for substitute checks. The final regulations also clarify some existing provisions of the rule and commentary. The final regulations can be found at:

http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2004/20040726/default.htm

THE SUBSTITUTE CHECK CLEARING PROCESS
Check 21 enables banks to clear checks electronically without having pre-existing agreements between the bank of first deposit and the paying bank. Below is an example of the steps that may be involved in the substitute check clearing process:

Step 1
A customer indorses an original check and deposits it with Bank 1, the Bank of First Deposit (BOFD). Bank 1 stamps its indorsement onto the back of the original check.

Step 2
Bank 1 decides to “truncate” the original check and is, therefore, the “truncating bank”[1] Bank 1, therefore, (1) captures an image of the front and back of the original check, (2) captures the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line data from the original check, and (3) sends to Bank 2, its correspondent bank, the image and MICR line data in lieu of the original check. Bank 1 also identifies itself as the truncating bank in the electronic records it sends to Bank 2. Note that in order for this scenario to occur, Bank 2 must have previously agreed to accept checks electronically from Bank 1. If Bank 2 had not so agreed, then Bank 1 would need to provide either the original check or a legally equivalent substitute check to Bank 2.

Step 3
Bank 2 applies its indorsement electronically and transfers the check image and MICR line data to Bank 3. Again, in order for this scenario to occur, Bank 3 must have previously agreed to accept checks electronically from Bank 2.

Step 4
Bank 3 desires to present the check for payment to Bank 4, the paying bank, but Bank 4 has not agreed to accept checks electronically. Accordingly, Bank 3 uses the information received from Bank 2 to create a substitute check, and Bank 3 is, therefore, the reconverting bank. As part of the substitute check creation process, Bank 3 (1) includes the image of the front of the original check on the front of the substitute check, (2) includes the image of the back of the original check on the back of the substitute check, and (3) applies the MICR line data from the original check to the bottom of the front of the substitute check. Additionally, Bank 3 overlays its own indorsement and the indorsement of Bank 2 onto the back of the substitute check at the time it creates the substitute check. (Bank 1’s indorsement, along with Bank 1’s depositor’s indorsement, is contained within the image of the back of the original check that Bank 3 applies to the back of the substitute check.) Bank 3 also identifies itself as the reconverting bank on the front and back of the substitute check and identifies Bank 1 as the truncating bank on the front of the substitute check. Bank 3 presents the substitute check to Bank 4, the paying bank, for payment.

Step 5
Bank 4, the paying bank, uses the MICR line data that Bank 3 applied to the bottom of the substitute check to process the substitute check in the same manner as it would have processed the original check. Bank 4 may provide the substitute check to its customer (who wrote the original check) in the customer’s monthly periodic statement.

If there had been insufficient funds to cover this substitute check, the paying bank could return it stamped NSF to Bank 1, the Bank of First Deposit. Regulation CC requires the reason for return to be stamped on the portion of the substitute check that contains the image of the original check. Bank 1 could then charge its customer’s account for the returned item and provide the substitute check with the chargeback notice.

UNIQUE CHECK 21 CONCEPTS
What is a substitute check? [Section 229.2(2)(aaa)]

A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that:

Contains an image of the front and back of the original check;
Bears a MICR line containing all the information from the original check’s MICR line, except as provided in ANS X9.100-140, to facilitate the processing of substitute checks;[2]
Conforms in paper stock, dimension, and otherwise with the industry standard for substitute checks, ANS X9.100-140; and
Is suitable for automated processing just like the original check.
When is a substitute check the legal equivalent of the original check?

A substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check if:

It accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time the original check was truncated;
It bears the Check 21 Act’s required legal equivalence legend:
“This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check;” and
A bank has made the Check 21 Act warranties with respect to the substitute check.
What is included in “all of the information” on the front and back of the original check?

“All of the information” includes the information from the original check that must be present on the substitute check in order for the substitute check to meet the Uniform Commercial Code’s (UCC) requirements for a negotiable instrument. This information includes the payment and indorsement information from the original check. A substitute check need not contain watermarks, decorative features, or security features that do not survive the imaging process.

One important point to remember is that substitute checks are checks and are, therefore, subject to existing check law, such as articles 3 and 4 of the UCC.

Substitute Check Warranties [Section 229.52]
Legal equivalence warranty [Section 229.52 (a)]

Beginning with the first reconverting bank in the check clearing process, any bank that transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of the operative substitute check, warrants to all subsequent transferees that the substitute check being transferred (or the substitute check from which the paper or electronic representation being transferred was derived) meets the requirements for legal equivalence.

Duplicative payment warranty [Section 229.52 (a) (2)]

The reconverting bank also warrants that no depositary bank, drawee, drawer, or indorser will be asked to make a payment based on a check it already has paid. A “check” includes any of the following items: a substitute check, the original check, or a paper or electronic representation of the substitute check or the original check.

Substitute Check Indemnity [Section 229.53]
Any bank that transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check or paper or electronic representation of a substitute check must indemnify the initial recipient and any subsequent recipient for losses suffered by the recipient because of receiving a substitute check instead of the original check.

An indemnity claim can be originated only by a recipient of a substitute check. By contrast, a recipient of a substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of a substitute check can originate a warranty claim.

Calculating recoverable losses

If the loss only involves a breach of the substitute check warranty, or only involves the indemnity, the claimant is entitled to damages up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest and expenses (i.e., reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses of representation).

If the loss involves both a breach of warranty claim and an indemnity claim, the claimant is entitled to damages up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest and expenses, as well as other proximately caused damages.

Another point to remember is that electronic check conversion (i.e., where information from a check is used to create an automated clearinghouse (ACH) debit) is similar to but separate from the check substitution process authorized by the Check 21 Act. The ACH electronic fund transfers between financial institutions are not considered check transactions and thus are not subject to check law. Rather, they are governed by the rule of the automated clearinghouse that processes the electronic fund transfer. ACH transactions to or from consumer accounts also are subject to the provisions of the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation E.

The Check 21 Act has implications for consumers and compliance considerations for insured institutions and regulators.

CONSUMER PROTECTION PROVISIONS
Consumer awareness disclosure [Section 229.57]
What is required?

The Check 21 Act requires banks to provide certain consumer customers with a disclosure that describes substitute checks and the rights consumers have when they receive substitute checks. The disclosure must describe 1) how substitute checks are the legal equivalent of original checks and 2) the Check 21 Act’s consumer expedited recredit procedures.

A bank that uses the consumer awareness disclosure language contained in model form C-5A in appendix C of Regulation CC is deemed to have complied with the content requirement(s) for which it used the model language, provided that the model language that the bank uses accurately describes the bank’s policies and practices.

Which consumer customers must receive the disclosure?

A consumer customer is a natural person who deposits a check into, cashes a check against, or draws a check on a deposit account that he or she uses primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.

Disclosure to consumer customers who receive paid checks with periodic account statements

A bank must provide the disclosure to a consumer customer who receives paid checks (which could include paid original checks and/or paid substitute checks) with his or her periodic account statement (1) no later than the bank’s first statement cycle after October 28, 2004, for each consumer who is a customer of the bank on that date; and (2) at the time the customer relationship is initiated, for each customer relationship established after that date.

Disclosure to consumers who receive substitute checks only on an occasional basis

If a bank provides a substitute check in response to a consumer’s request for a copy of a check, the bank must provide the disclosure at the time of the request, if feasible, and, otherwise, no later than when the bank provides the substitute check. If a bank provides a consumer a returned substitute check, the consumer disclosure must be provided at the time the bank provides the substitute check. A bank must provide the disclosure on these occasional bases even if the consumer previously received the disclosure (for example, because the consumer is a customer who receives paid checks with his or her monthly account statement).

Consumer expedited recredit rights [Section 229.54]
The consumer expedited recredit provision only applies to “consumers” (not business customers) who have received a substitute check and have had a transaction involving a substitute check charged to their account. Because the Check 21 Act defines “account” as a deposit account, the expedited recredit procedures only apply to substitute checks charged to a consumer deposit account. Credit card checks, checks a consumer draws on a home equity line of credit, or checks a consumer draws on a brokerage clearing account would, therefore, generally not trigger the expedited recredit procedures. Such checks could only trigger the expedited recredit procedures if a consumer had deposited such a check into his or her deposit account, the check were returned unpaid, and the bank provided the returned check to the consumer depositor in the form of a substitute check. Note: The UCC provisions that prohibit a bank from making unauthorized charges to the consumer’s account still apply regardless of whether the expedited recredit procedure applies.

To use the expedited recredit procedure, the consumer must be able to assert in good faith that the:

Consumer’s account was charged for a substitute check;
Consumer’s account was improperly charged or the consumer has a warranty claim related to the substitute check;
Consumer suffered a loss; and
Consumer needs the original check or a “sufficient copy” to determine the validity of the claim.
A “sufficient copy” is defined in Section 229.2 (bbb) as “a copy of an original check that accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time the original check was truncated or is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not a claim is valid.”

How does a consumer file an expedited recredit claim?

A consumer must file an expedited recredit claim so that the bank receives it within 40 calendar days from the later of the date that the bank mailed, or delivered by a means agreed to by the consumer, (1) the account statement showing the transaction that gave rise to the claim or (2) the substitute check that gave rise to the claim. (The bank is required to extend the time for making a claim in extenuating circumstances. Additionally, the bank also has the latitude under the final rules to extend the 40-day time period for consumer action, so that it can parallel the 60-day claim period under Regulation E involving claims for disputed electronic fund transfers).

To make a claim for expedited recredit, a consumer must provide:

A description of why the consumer believes the account was improperly charged or the nature of the consumer’s warranty claim;
A statement that a loss occurred, including an estimate of the amount;
The reason why producing the original check or a sufficient copy is necessary to determine the validity of the charge; and
Sufficient information to identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim.
Other requirements
The bank has a duty to inform the consumer whether his or her complaint is incomplete (and thus is not yet a “claim” for purposes of the expedited recredit procedure) and must identify what information is missing. A bank’s “clock” for responding does not begin to tick until the consumer submits a complete claim.

If a bank requires a written claim and the consumer attempts to submit a claim orally, the bank must, at the time of the attempted oral claim submission, inform the consumer of the written claim submission requirement. The consumer awareness disclosure that the bank distributes also should inform the consumer of the written claim requirement.

If the bank requires the claim to be in writing, the consumer must submit the written claim so that the bank receives it either (1) within 10 business days of the date of notification of the written claim requirement, or (2) within the “basic” 40-calendar-day time period (discussed above) for filing a claim, whichever is later.

If an oral claim is made within the 40-day period and the consumer meets the 10 day written notification requirement, the consumer’s claim is timely even if the written claim is received after the “basic” 40-day period.

Bank options for responding to consumer claims
A bank that receives an expedited recredit claim must take one of the following actions:

Approve the claim and provide a full recredit no later than the business day after making that determination. In this case, the bank must send a notice of recredit no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank recredits the consumer’s account;
Deny the claim and demonstrate to the consumer why the claim is not valid. The bank must send a notice demonstrating that the consumer’s claim is not valid no later than the business day after the banking day on which it makes this determination; or
If the bank has not taken an action described in (1) or (2) by the tenth business day after the banking day on which the bank received the claim, the bank must provisionally recredit a consumer’s account pending further investigation. The bank must provide notice of the provisional recredit no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank recredits the consumer’s account.
If the bank provisionally recredits a consumer’s account pending further investigation, the bank is required to recredit the amount of the consumer’s loss, up to the amount of the substitute check or $2,500, whichever is less. The bank must also recredit interest on that amount if the consumer’s account is an interest-bearing account. The bank would recredit any remaining amount (plus applicable interest) on the 45th calendar day after receiving the claim, unless before that time the bank had already made a determination concerning either the validity or invalidity of the consumer’s claim.

If the bank later determines that the claim was not valid, the bank may reverse the recredit (notwithstanding whether the bank’s recredit to the consumer’s account was provided under (1) or (3) above). The bank must provide a notice of reversal of recredit no later than the business day after the banking day on which the bank makes the reversal.

The Federal Reserve Board has provided model notices in appendix C that banks may use in responding to consumer expedited recredit claims under §229.54(e). Unlike the model consumer awareness disclosure form C-5A, however, use of these model notices does not provide banks with a statutory safe harbor.

COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS FOR BANKS
A bank is not required to create substitute checks or to accept checks electronically. However, on October 28, 2004, a bank, at a minimum, should be prepared to receive a substitute check in place of an original check. Banks that choose to create substitute checks will take on additional duties with respect to the substitute check.

Duties for all banks
All banks that transfer, present, or return a substitute check for consideration thereby make the substitute check warranties and indemnities described in Regulation CC. However, in the vast majority of cases, liability for the warranties and indemnity ultimately will flow back to the reconverting bank.

Because a substitute check must be suitable for automated processing in the same manner as an original check, a bank that receives a substitute check will not need to change its equipment and will need to make only minor processing changes if it returns a substitute check.

A bank that returns a substitute check must place the reason for return within the portion of the substitute check that contains the image of the original check; and a bank that qualifies a substitute check for return must encode position 44 of the return MICR line with a “5” instead of a “2.”

Duties of the reconverting bank [Section 229.51]
The Check 21 Act is designed so that losses associated with a substitute check are borne by the reconverting bank.

A reconverting bank is defined in the Check 21 Act as the bank that creates a substitute check; or, if the substitute check is created by a nonbank, the first bank that transfers or presents the substitute check (or in lieu thereof the first paper or electronic representation of that substitute check).

The reconverting bank must:

Identify itself as a reconverting bank on the substitute check;
Preserve all previous reconverting bank identifications;
Ensure that the substitute check bears all previously applied indorsements; and
Identify the bank that truncated the original check.
Pursuant to the Check 21 Act, the reconverting bank and each bank that subsequently transfers, presents, or returns the substitute check for consideration makes two warranties:

First, that the substitute check meets the legal equivalence requirements (See above for what these legal equivalence requirements are.), and
Second, that a paying bank will not be asked to make payment on an item that it has already paid.
Note that the reconverting bank is responsible for the legal equivalence warranty even if a substitute check’s failure to accurately represent the payment information from the original check is the result of the drawer using an ink type or color that does not survive the image capturing process or is the result of receiving a poor image file from an electronic sender. However, a reconverting bank can attempt to further allocate warranty losses by agreement.

Note that the responsibility of the reconverting bank for the duplicative payment warranty and for the indemnity does not depend upon knowledge or fault. Also note that the duplicative payment warranty applies only to charges initiated by check, as opposed to ACH debits.

Interbank expedited recredit rights [Section 229.55]
Interbank expedited recredit rights allow a bank to recover losses associated with a consumer expedited recredit claim from the indemnifying bank that sent the item in question.

The claimant bank can submit a claim to cover losses associated with providing an expedited recredit to a consumer or another bank involved in the collection process. This claim must be submitted by close-of-business on the 120th calendar day after the claimant bank processed the substitute check in question.

The indemnifying bank has 10 days after receipt of the claim to provide: 1) a recredit; 2) the original check, or 3) a “sufficient copy.”

CHECK 21 EXAMINATIONS – COMPLIANCE
In evaluating a financial institution’s compliance with the Check 21 provisions of Regulation CC, examiners should generally focus their evaluation on meeting two objectives:

Determining the financial institution’s compliance with subpart D notice content and timing requirements (general consumer awareness disclosures regarding substitute checks and notices that respond to a consumer’s expedited recredit claim regarding a substitute check error), and
Ascertaining whether the financial institution complies with timing requirements for acting on a substitute check expedited recredit claim.
Preliminary review of documents that demonstrate the financial institution’s compliance with the notice requirements can include, but are not limited to:

Consumer awareness notice(s)
Sample (test) substitute checks, if available
Direct mail correspondence, statement stuffers, et. al. describing Check 21/substitute check implementation to consumer customers
Notices relating to expedited recredit claims:
Notice of valid claim and refund
Notice of provisional refund
Denial of claim
Reversal of refund
Review of the financial institution’s training manual, procedures manual, internal audit reports, and board meeting minutes can reveal the extent to which the financial institution’s compliance risk management program has responded to the Check 21 provisions. Additionally, interviews with key staff members, including new accounts personnel and deposit operations, can identify how effectively the institution’s management has communicated its response to this new regulation to the individuals responsible for ensuring compliance.

The FFIEC has approved examination procedures that discuss the steps examiners should follow to evaluate a financial institution’s effective use of the consumer awareness notice and handling of any consumer claims of Check 21-related losses. Those examination procedures can be found on the Examination Procedures link above.

CONCLUSION
As we wrap up our Check 21 training, the most important learning you need to come away with is fairly simple.

Check 21 Does Not
Require banks to accept check images (image exchange must still take place under agreements)
Give legal equivalence to check images
Mandate check truncation
Mandate destruction of original checks
Exclude business or U.S. Treasury checks
Pertain to checks that are converted to ACH transactions
Check 21 Does
Create a new negotiable instrument (called a substitute check)
Provide that a properly prepared substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check
Provide that any check is eligible to become a substitute check
Require banks to accept legally equivalent substitute checks
The Law – Check 21 Act
Authorizes substitute checks and defines the look, format and other features

No person or entity is required to issue a substitute check. However, a properly prepared substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check. Therefore, a paying bank must receive a legally equivalent substitute check just as it would the original check.

Protects recipients of substitute checks

Warranties and Indemnity
Two warranties
Legal equivalence warranty
No double debit warranty
Indemnity against losses due to the receipt of a substitute check in lieu of the original check
Expedited recredit for consumers
Expedited recredit for banks
Requires consumer awareness

All existing consumer customers who routinely receive canceled checks in their periodic statement must be provided a disclosure no later than the first statement after October 28, 2004.

After that date, all new consumer customers who receive canceled checks or substitute checks must be provided a disclosure when the new account is opened.

This disclosure must:

Explain that a substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check, and
Describe the consumer’s rights for recredit for substitute checks not properly charged to the consumer’s account.
Model disclosure for banks to use – Appendix C, form C-5A of Regulation CC.

Consumers who receive substitute checks on an occasional basis (e.g., consumers who request a copy of a check and receive a substitute check or who receive, in the form of a substitute check, a previously deposited item that has been returned unpaid) must also be provided the disclosure.

When the consumer contacts the bank to request a copy of a check (where possible), the bank should provide the model disclosure at the time of the request.
If that is not feasible, the disclosure should be provided no later than when the substitute check is provided.
When a substitute check is provided as a returned deposited item, the disclosure should be included along with the substitute check.
This concludes our Check 21 training. Please visit our Resources page located above on this FFIEC Web site. You will also find other Web links and additional information there.

Footnotes
[1]Under § 229.2(ddd), “truncate means to remove an original check from the forward collection or return process and send to a recipient, in lieu of such original check, a substitute check, or, by agreement, information relating to the original check (including data taken from the MICR line of the original check or an electronic image of the original check), whether with or without the subsequent delivery of the original check. Under § 229.2(eee), a “truncating bank” is defined as follows: “(1) The bank that truncates the original check; or (2) If a person other than a bank truncates the original check, the first bank that transfers, presents, or returns, in lieu of such original check, a substitute check or, by agreement with the recipient, information relating to the original check (including data taken from the MICR line of the original check or an electronic image of the original check), whether with or without the subsequent delivery of the original check.”

## About releases

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae > 3.3 %}
![An overview of releases](/assets/images/help/releases/refreshed-releases-overview-with-contributors.png)
{% else %}
![An overview of releases](/assets/images/help/releases/releases-overview.png)
{% endif %}

Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.

Releases are based on [Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging), which mark a specific point in your repository's history. A tag date may be different than a release date since they can be created at different times. For more information about viewing your existing tags, see "[Viewing your repository's releases and tags](/github/administering-a-repository/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags)."

You can receive notifications when new releases are published in a repository without receiving notifications about other updates to the repository. For more information, see "[Viewing your subscriptions](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions)."

Anyone with read access to a repository can view and compare releases, but only people with write permissions to a repository can manage releases. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae > 3.3 %}
You can manually create release notes while managing a release. Alternatively, you can automatically generate release notes from a default template, or customize your own release notes template. For more information, see "[Automatically generated release notes](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.5 or ghae > 3.6 %}
When viewing the details for a release, the creation date for each release asset is shown next to the release asset.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
People with admin permissions to a repository can choose whether {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %} ({% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}) objects are included in the ZIP files and tarballs that {% data variables.product.product_name %} creates for each release. For more information, see "[Managing {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in archives of your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-git-lfs-objects-in-archives-of-your-repository)."

If a release fixes a security vulnerability, you should publish a security advisory in your repository. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} reviews each published security advisory and may use it to send {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} to affected repositories. For more information, see "[About GitHub Security Advisories](/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories)."

You can view the **Dependents** tab of the dependency graph to see which repositories and packages depend on code in your repository, and may therefore be affected by a new release. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/about-the-dependency-graph)."
{% endif %}

You can also use the Releases API to gather information, such as the number of times people download a release asset. For more information, see "[Releases](/rest/reference/releases)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
## Storage and bandwidth quotas

 Each file included in a release must be under {% data variables.large_files.max_file_size %}. There is no limit on the total size of a release, nor bandwidth usage.

{% endif %}
