A repository's graphs give you information on {% ifversion fpt or ghec %} traffic, projects that depend on the repository,{% endif %} contributors and commits to the repository, and a repository's forks and network. If you maintain a repository, you can use this data to get a better understanding of who's using your repository and why they're using it.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

Some repository graphs are available only in public repositories with {% data variables.product.prodname_free_user %}:
- Pulse
- Contributors
- Traffic
- Commits
- Code frequency
- Network

All other repository graphs are available in all repositories. Every repository graph is available in public and private repositories with {% data variables.product.prodname_pro %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. {% data reusables.gated-features.more-info %}

   72 | A "cookie" is a text file which saves information relating to an Internet users browsing on the Internet. Cookies are controlled by the web browser of an Internet user’s computer. As far as Internet users are concerned, "cookies" are the best method which can be used to customise the user’s browsing on the Internet. The use of cookies means that Internet users avoid being bombarded with the same advertising messages and questions on certain sites, and they also save time on other sites, especially on sites where it is necessary to enter a login or password. As far as Histats is concerned "cookies" are used to carry out relevant and detailed statistical research. Thanks to the use of "cookies" it becomes possible to refine the analyses of JavaScript tags, and they also enable Histats customers to recognise visitors each time they visit their site (i.e. to find out that it is the same visitor without knowing who they are). These "cookies" store a unique alphanumeric ID only, relating to the device used by an Internet user, and under no circumstances is this information used to collect nominative information on the visitors. All of the results which are obtained are then compiled, and are completely anonymous. The results provide information on the browsing and behaviour of Internet users on the websites of Histats customers, information such as: the number of visitors, the number of visits, the number of page views and other information that is necessary for the effective measurement of Internet user interests. With these results it is then possible to improve the ergonomics and content of such websites. Lastly, the Histats Service can use either the cookie known as "first party" (issued by the URL of the website tracked by AT Internet) or the cookie known as "third party" (issued by a URL belonging to Histats: .histats.com ) depending on the needs of our customer. In both cases, the reason for using the cookie remains the same as the reasoning explained above and no personal data is collected via these cookies.

As far as Internet users are concerned, "cookies" are the best method which can be used to customise the user’s browsing on the Internet. The use of cookies means that Internet users avoid being bombarded with the same advertising messages and questions on certain sites, and they also save time on other sites, especially on sites where it is necessary to enter a login or password. As far as Histats is concerned "cookies" are used to carry out relevant and detailed statistical research. Thanks to the use of "cookies" it becomes possible to refine the analyses of JavaScript tags, and they also enable Histats customers to recognise visitors each time they visit their site (i.e. to find out that it is the same visitor without knowing who they are). These "cookies" store a unique alphanumeric ID only, relating to the device used by an Internet user, and under no circumstances is this information used to collect nominative information on the visitors. All of the results which are obtained are then compiled, and are completely anonymous. The results provide information on the browsing and behaviour of Internet users on the websites of Histats customers, information such as: the number of visitors, the number of visits, the number of page views and other information that is necessary for the effective measurement of Internet user interests. With these results it is then possible to improve the ergonomics and content of such websites. Lastly, the Histats Service can use either the cookie known as "first party" (issued by the URL of the website tracked by AT Internet) or the cookie known as "third party" (issued by a URL belonging to Histats: .histats.com ) depending on the needs of our customer.

  180 | A "cookie" is a text file which saves information relating to an Internet users browsing on the Internet. Cookies are controlled by the web browser of an Internet user’s computer. As far as Internet users are concerned, "cookies" are the best method which can be used to customise the user’s browsing on the Internet. The use of cookies means that Internet users avoid being bombarded with the same advertising messages and questions on certain sites, and they also save time on other sites, especially on sites where it is necessary to enter a login or password. As far as Histats is concerned "cookies" are used to carry out relevant and detailed statistical research. Thanks to the use of "cookies" it becomes possible to refine the analyses of JavaScript tags, and they also enable Histats customers to recognise visitors each time they visit their site (i.e. to find out that it is the same visitor without knowing who they are). These "cookies" store a unique alphanumeric ID only, relating to the device used by an Internet user, and under no circumstances is this information used to collect nominative information on the visitors. All of the results which are obtained are then compiled, and are completely anonymous. The results provide information on the browsing and behaviour of Internet users on the websites of Histats customers, information such as: the number of visitors, the number of visits, the number of page views and other information that is necessary for the effective measurement of Internet user interests. With these results it is then possible to improve the ergonomics and content of such websites. Lastly, the Histats Service can use either the cookie known as "first party" (issued by the URL of the website tracked by AT Internet) or the cookie known as "third party" (issued by a URL belonging to Histats: .histats.com ) depending on the needs of our customer. In both cases, the reason for using the cookie remains the same as the reasoning explained above and no personal data is collected via these cookies.
