title: Finding files on GitHub
intro: 'You can search for a file in a repository using the file finder. To search for a file in multiple repositories on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, use the {% ifversion code-search-code-view %}[`path` code search qualifier](/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax#path-qualifier){% else %}[`filename` code search qualifier](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code#search-by-filename){% endif %}.'

**Tips:**

- By default, file finder results exclude some directories like `build`, `log`, `tmp`, and `vendor`. To search for files in these directories, {% ifversion code-search-code-view %}use the [`path` code search qualifier](/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax#path-qualifier){% else %}use the [`filename` code search qualifier](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code#search-by-filename){% endif %}.{% ifversion file-finder-exclusion-controls %} Alternatively, you can customize which directories are excluded by default [using a `.gitattributes` file](#customizing-excluded-files).{% endif %}
- You can also open the file finder by pressing `t` on your keyboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts)."

## Using the file finder

{% ifversion code-search-code-view %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
1. In the file tree view, click the {% octicon "filter" aria-hidden="true" %} **Jump to file** search bar. You can also find the {% octicon "filter" aria-hidden="true" %} **Jump to file** search bar at the top of the integrated file editor.

1. In the search bar, type the name of the file or directory you'd like to find.
1. In the list of results, click the file or directory you wanted to find. You can view the file path for a directory or file below each search result.
{% else %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
1. Above the list of files, click **Go to file**.

1. In the list of results, click the file you wanted to find.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion file-finder-exclusion-controls %}

## Customizing excluded files

By default, file finder results do not include files in the following directories if they exist at your repository root:

- `.git`
- `.hg`
- `.sass-cache`
- `.svn`
- `build`
- `dot_git`
- `log`
- `tmp`
- `vendor`

You can override these default exclusions using a `.gitattributes` file.

To do this, create or update a file called `.gitattributes` in your repository root, setting the [`linguist-generated`](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/master/docs/overrides.md) attribute to `false` for each directory that should be included in file finder results.

For example, the following `.gitattributes` file would cause files in the `build/` directory to be available to the file finder:

```
build/** linguist-generated=false
```

Note that this override requires the use of the recursive glob pattern (`**`). For more information, see "[pattern format](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)" in the Git documentation. More complex overrides of subdirectories within excluded-by-default directories are not supported.
