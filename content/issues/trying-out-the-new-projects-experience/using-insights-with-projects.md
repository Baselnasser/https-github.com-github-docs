## About insights

You can use insights to view and customize charts that use the items added to your project as their source data. The default "Burn up" chart shows item status over time, allowing you to visualize progress and spot patterns over time.

You can apply filters to the default chart and also create your own charts. When you create a chart, you set the filters, chart type, and the information displayed, and the chart is available to anyone that can view the project.
