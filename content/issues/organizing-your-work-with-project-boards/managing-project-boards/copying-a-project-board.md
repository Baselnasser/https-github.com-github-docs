{% data reusables.projects.project_boards_old %}

Copying a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} allows you to reuse a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}'s title, description, and automation configuration. You can copy {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_boards %} to eliminate the manual process of creating new {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_boards %} for similar workflows.

You must have read access to a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} to copy it to a repository or organization where you have write access.

When you copy a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} to an organization, the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}'s visibility will default to private, with an option to change the visibility. For more information, see "[Changing {% data variables.product.prodname_project_v1 %} visibility](/articles/changing-project-board-visibility/)."

A {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}'s automation is also enabled by default. For more information, see "[About automation for {% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v1 %}](/articles/about-automation-for-project-boards/)."

1. Navigate to the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} you want to copy.
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}
3. Click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}, then click **Copy**.
