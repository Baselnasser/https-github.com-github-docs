**Tips:**
- You can format your note using Markdown syntax. For example, you can use headings, links, task lists, or emoji. For more information, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)."
- You can drag and drop or use keyboard shortcuts to reorder notes and move them between columns. {% data reusables.project-management.for-more-info-project-keyboard-shortcuts %}
- Your {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} must have at least one column before you can add notes. For more information, see "[Creating a project board](/articles/creating-a-project-board)."

{% endtip %}

When you add a URL for an issue, pull request, or another {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} to a note, you'll see a preview in a summary card below your text.

## Converting a note to an issue

If you've created a note and find that it isn't sufficient for your needs, you can convert it to an issue.

When you convert a note to an issue, the issue is automatically created using the content from the note. The first line of the note will be the issue title and any additional content from the note will be added to the issue description.

{% tip %}

**Tip:** You can add content in the body of your note to @mention someone, link to another issue or pull request, and add emoji. These {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Flavored Markdown features aren't supported within {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} notes, but once your note is converted to an issue, they'll appear correctly. For more information on using these features, see "[About writing and formatting on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)."

{% endtip %}

1. Navigate to the note that you want to convert to an issue.
{% data reusables.project-management.project-note-more-options %}
3. Click **Convert to issue**.
