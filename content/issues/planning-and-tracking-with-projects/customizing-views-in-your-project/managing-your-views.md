## Creating a project view

Project views allow you to quickly view specific aspects of your project. Each view is displayed on a separate tab in your project. 

For example, you can have:
- A view that shows all items not yet started (filter on "Status").
- A view that shows the workload for each team (group by a custom "Team" field).
- A view that shows the items with the earliest target ship date (sort by a date field).

To add a new view:

{% data reusables.projects.new-view %}

Alternatively, open the project command palette by pressing {% data variables.projects.command-palette-shortcut %} and start typing "New view."

The new view is automatically saved.

## Duplicating a view

You can duplicate an existing view and use it as a base to make further changes.

1. Switch to the view you want to duplicate.
{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click {% octicon "versions" aria-label="the versions icon" %} **Duplicate view**.

## Saving changes to a view

When you make changes to a view - for example, sorting, reordering, filtering, or grouping the data in a view - a dot is displayed next to the view name to indicate that there are unsaved changes.

If you don't want to save the changes, you can ignore this indicator. No one else will see your changes.

{% data reusables.projects.save-view %}

Alternatively, open the project command palette by pressing {% data variables.projects.command-palette-shortcut %} and start typing "Save view."

## Reordering saved views

To change the order of the tabs that contain your saved views, click and drag a tab to a new location. The new tab order is automatically saved.

## Renaming a saved view

You can rename your saved views. The name change is automatically saved.

1. Switch to the view you want to rename.
{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click {% octicon "pencil" aria-label="the pencil icon" %} **Rename view**.
   ![Screenshot showing the rename menu item](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/rename-view.png)
1. Type the new name for your view.
1. To save your changes, press <kbd>Return</kbd>.

## Deleting a saved view

1. Switch to the view you want to delete.
{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click {% octicon "trash" aria-label="the trasj icon" %} **Delete view**.
   ![Screenshot showing the rename delete item](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/delete-view.png)

Alternatively, open the project command palette by pressing {% data variables.projects.command-palette-shortcut %} and start typing "Delete view."
