## Changing the project layout

You can set each view in your project to a different layout.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Under "Layout", click either **Table**{% ifversion projects-v2-roadmaps %}, **Board** or **Roadmap**{% else %} or **Board**{% endif %}.


Alternatively, open the project command palette by pressing {% data variables.projects.command-palette-shortcut %} and start typing "Switch layout."
