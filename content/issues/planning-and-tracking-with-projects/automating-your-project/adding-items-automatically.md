## About automatically adding items

You can configure your project's built-in workflows to automatically add new items as they are created or updated in a repository. You can define a filter to only add items that meet your criteria.

When you enable the auto-add workflow, existing items matching your criteria will not be added. The workflow will add items when created or updated if the item matches your filter. For more information on manually adding items, see "[Bulk adding issues and pull requests](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project#bulk-adding-issues-and-pull-requests)."

The auto-add workflow supports a subset of filters. You can use the following filters when configuring your workflow.

| Qualifier | Possible values
| --- | --- | --- |
| `is` | open, closed, merged, draft, issue, pr
| `label` | "label name"
| `reason` | completed, reopened, "not planned"
| `assignee` | {% data variables.product.product_name %} username
| `no` | label, assignee, reason

All filters, other than `no`, support negation. For example, you could use `-label:bug` to add issues that do not have the "bug" label.
