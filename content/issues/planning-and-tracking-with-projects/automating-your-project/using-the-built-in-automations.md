{% note %}

**Note:** Built-in workflows are available as part of a limited beta.

{% endnote %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v2 %} includes built-in workflows that you can use to update the **Status** of items based on certain events. For example, you can automatically set the status to **Todo** when an item is added to your project or set the status to **Done** when an issue is closed.

When your project initializes, two workflows are enabled by default: When issues or pull requests in your project are closed, their status is set to **Done**, and when pull requests in your project are merged, their status is set to **Done**.

{% ifversion projects-v2-auto-archive %}You can also configure {% ifversion projects-v2-auto-add %}workflows{% else %}a workflow{% endif %} to automatically archive items when they meet set criteria{% ifversion projects-v2-auto-add %} and to automatically add items from a repository when they match a filter{% endif %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/archiving-items-automatically){% ifversion projects-v2-auto-add %}" and "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/adding-items-automatically){% endif %}."{% endif %}

You can enable or disable the built-in workflows for your project.
