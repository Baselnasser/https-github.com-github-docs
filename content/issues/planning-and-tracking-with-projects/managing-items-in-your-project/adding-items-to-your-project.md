### Creating draft issues

Draft issues are useful to quickly capture ideas. Unlike issues and pull requests that are referenced from your repositories, draft issues exist only in your project.

{% data reusables.projects.add-draft-issue %}

Draft issues can have a title, text body, assignees, and any custom fields from your project. In order to populate the repository, labels, or milestones for a draft issue, you must first convert the draft issue to an issue. For more information, see "[Converting draft issues to issues](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/converting-draft-issues-to-issues)."

{% note %}

**Note**: Users will not receive notifications when they are assigned to or mentioned in a draft issue unless the draft issue is converted to an issue.
