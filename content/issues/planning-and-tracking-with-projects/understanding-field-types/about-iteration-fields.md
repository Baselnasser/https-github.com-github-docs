You can create an iteration field to associate items with specific repeating blocks of time. Iterations can be set to any length of time, can include breaks, and can be individually edited to modify name and date range. With projects, you can group by iteration to visualize the balance of upcoming work, use filters to focus on a single iteration, and sort by iteration.

You can filter for iterations by specifying the iteration name or `@current` for the current iteration, `@previous` for the previous iteration, or `@next` for the next iteration. You can also use operators such as `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `..`.  For example, `iteration:>"Iteration 4"` and `iteration:<@current`. For more information, see "[Filtering projects](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/filtering-projects)."

When you first create an iteration field, three iterations are automatically created.  You can add additional iterations and make other changes on your project's settings page.

## Adding an iteration field

{% data reusables.projects.new-field %}
1. Select **Iteration**

2. Optionally, if you don't want the iteration to start today, select the calendar dropdown next to "Starts on" and choose a new start date.

Alternatively, open the project command palette by pressing {% data variables.projects.command-palette-shortcut %} and start typing "Create new field."

## Adding new iterations

{% data reusables.projects.project-settings %}
1. Click the name of the iteration field you want to adjust.
   ![Screenshot showing an iteration field](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/select-iteration-field.png)
1. To add a new iteration of the same duration, click **Add iteration**.

1. Optionally, to customize the duration of the new iteration and when it will start, click {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-label="The triangle icon" %} **More options**, select a starting date and duration, and click **Add**.

## Editing an iteration

You can edit iterations in your project settings. You can also access the settings for an iteration field by clicking {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-label="The triangle icon" %} in the table header for the field and clicking **Edit values**.

{% data reusables.projects.project-settings %}
1. Click the name of the iteration field you want to adjust.
   ![Screenshot showing an iteration field](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/select-iteration-field.png)
1. To change the name of an iteration, click on the name and start typing.

1. To change the date or duration of an iteration, click on the date to open the calendar. Click on the start day, then click the end day, and then click **Apply**.
   ![Screenshot showing iteration dates](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/iteration-date.png)
1. Optionally, to delete an iteration, click {% octicon "trash" aria-label="The trash icon" %}.
   ![Screenshot the delete button](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/iteration-delete.png)
2. Click **Save changes**.

## Inserting a break

You can insert breaks into your iterations to communicate when you are taking time away from scheduled work. The duration of a new break defaults to the length of the most recently created iteration.

{% data reusables.projects.project-settings %}
1. Click the name of the iteration field you want to adjust.
   ![Screenshot showing an iteration field](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/select-iteration-field.png)
2. On the dividing line above an iteration and to the right, click **Insert break**.
   ![Screenshot showing location of "Insert break" button](/assets/images/help/issues/iteration-insert-break.png)
3. Optionally, to change the duration of the break, click on the date to open the calendar. Click on the start day, then click the end day, and then click **Apply**.
4. Click **Save changes**.
