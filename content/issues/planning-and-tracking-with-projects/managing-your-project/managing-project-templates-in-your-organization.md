## About templates

You can set a project as a template to share a pre-configured project with other people in your organization which they can then use as the base for their projects.

The projects you have marked as templates are made available in the "Select a template" pop-up window when other people create projects in your organization.

When someone creates a project from a template, the views, custom fields, and draft issues are copied from the template to the new project.

## Setting a project as a template

If you have admin permissions for a project in your organization, you can set the project as a template and make it available for others in your organization to use.

{% data reusables.projects.project-settings %}
1. In the "Templates" section, next to "Make template", select the switch to toggle it to **On**.

## Finding templates in your organization

You can filter the list of projects in your organization to only show projects set as templates.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.projects.projects-tab %}
1. In the text box above the list of projects, type `is:template`, and press **Enter**.

## Copying a project as a template

If you have write or admin permissions for a project in your organization, you can choose to copy the project as a template. This will make a duplicate of the current project, copying the views, custom fields, and draft issues, and set that copied project as a template for your organization.

{% data reusables.projects.project-settings %}
1. In the "Templates" section, click {% octicon "duplicate" aria-hidden="true" %} **Copy as template**.
