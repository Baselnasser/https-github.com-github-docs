## About project visibility

Projects can be public or private. For public projects, everyone on the internet can view the project. For private projects, only users granted at least read access can see the project.

Only the project visibility is affected; to view an item on the project, someone must have the required permissions for the repository that the item belongs to. If your project includes items from a private repository, people who are not collaborators in the repository will not be able to view items from that repository.

Project admins and organization owners can control project visibility. Organization owners can restrict the ability to change project visibility to just organization owners.

In public and private projects, insights are only visible to users with write permissions for the project.

In private, organization-owned projects, the avatars of users who are current making updates to the project are displayed in the project UI.

Project admins can also manage write and admin access to their project and control read access for individual users. For more information, see "[Managing access to your projects](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects)."
