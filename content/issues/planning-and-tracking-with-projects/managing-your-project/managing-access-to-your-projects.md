## About project access

Admins of organization-level projects can manage access for the entire organization, for teams, for individual organization members, and for outside collaborators. 

Admins of user-level projects can invite individual collaborators and manage their access.

Project admins can also control the visibility of their project for everyone on the internet. For more information, see "[Managing the visibility of your projects](/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/managing-the-visibility-of-your-projects)."

## Managing access for organization-level projects

### Managing access for everyone in your organization

The default base role is `write`, meaning that everyone in the organization can see and edit your project. To change project access for everyone in the organization, you can change the base role. Changes to the base role only affect organization members who are not organization owners and who are not granted individual access.

{% data reusables.projects.project-settings %}
1. Click **Manage access**.

2. Under **Base role**, select the default role.
   ![Screenshot showing the base role menu](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/base-role.png)
   - **No access**: Only organization owners and users granted individual access can see the project. Organization owners are also admins for the project.
   - **Read**: Everyone in the organization can see the project. Organization owners are also admins for the project.
   - **Write**: Everyone in the organization can see and edit the project. Organization owners are also admins for the project.
   - **Admin**: Everyone in the organization is an admin for the project.

### Managing access for teams and individual members of your organization

You can also add teams, external collaborators, and individual organization members as collaborators for an organization-level project. For more information, see "[About teams](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

You can only invite an individual user to collaborate on your organization-level project if they are already a member of the organization or an outside collaborator on at least one repository in the organization.

{% data reusables.projects.project-settings %}
1. Click **Manage access**.

## Managing access for user-level projects

### Granting a collaborator access to your project

{% note %}

This only affects collaborators for your project, not for repositories in your project. To view an item on the project, someone must have the required permissions for the repository that the item belongs to. If your project includes items from a private repository, people who are not collaborators in the repository will not be able to view items from that repository. For more information, see "[Setting repository visibility](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility)" and "[Managing teams and people with access to your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository)."
