## About {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is an AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code. You can receive suggestions from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} analyzes the context in the file you are editing, as well as related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}'s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim and the JetBrains suite of IDEs. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot)."

## Using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}

You can see real-world examples of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} in action. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}](https://copilot.github.com/) website.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} offers suggestions from a model that OpenAI built from billions of lines of open source code. As a result, the training set for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} produces suggestions based on this training data, those suggestions may also contain undesirable patterns.

You are responsible for ensuring the security and quality of your code. We recommend you take the same precautions when using code generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} that you would when using any code you didn't write yourself. These precautions include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and tracking for security vulnerabilities. {% data variables.product.company_short %} provides a number of features to help you monitor and improve code quality, such as {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. All these features are free to use in public repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/github-security-features)."

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} uses filters to block offensive words in the prompts and avoid producing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We are committed to constantly improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive suggestions generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, including biased, discriminatory, or abusive outputs. If you see an offensive suggestion generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, please report the suggestion directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards.
