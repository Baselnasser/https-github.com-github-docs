{% ifversion packages-registries-v2 %}
The permissions for packages can be scoped either to a user or an organization or to a repository.

## Granular permissions for user/organization-scoped packages

Packages with granular permissions are scoped to a personal user or organization account. You can change the access control and visibility of the package separately from a repository that is connected (or linked) to a package.

The following {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} registries support granular permissions.

- {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}
{% ifversion packages-npm-v2 %}- npm registry{% endif %}
{% ifversion packages-nuget-v2 %}- NuGet registry{% endif %}
{% ifversion packages-rubygems-v2 %}- RubyGems registry{% endif %}

{% endif %}

## Permissions for {% ifversion packages-registries-v2 %}repository-scoped {% endif %}packages

A {% ifversion packages-registries-v2 %}repository-scoped {% endif %}package inherits the permissions and visibility of the repository that owns the package. You can find a package scoped to a repository by going to the main page of the repository and clicking the **Packages** link to the right of the page. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}For more information, see "[Connecting a repository to a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/connecting-a-repository-to-a-package)."{% endif %}

{% ifversion packages-registries-v2 %}
The following {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} registries **only** support repository-scoped permissions.

{% ifversion not fpt or ghec %}- Docker registry (`docker.pkg.github.com`){% endif %}
{% ifversion packages-npm-v2 %}{% else %}- npm registry{% endif %}
- Apache Maven registry
- Gradle registry
{% ifversion packages-nuget-v2 %}{% else %}- NuGet registry{% endif %}
{% ifversion packages-rubygems-v2 %}{% else %}- RubyGems registry{% endif %}

For {% ifversion ghes %}the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}{% else %}other registries{% endif %}, you can choose to allow packages to be scoped to a user or an organization, or linked to a repository. {% ifversion docker-ghcr-enterprise-migration %}For information about migration to the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}, see "[Migrating to the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} from the Docker registry](/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/migrating-to-the-container-registry-from-the-docker-registry)."{% endif %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion packages-registries-v2 %}
## Visibility and access permissions for container images

{% data reusables.package_registry.visibility-and-access-permissions %}

{% endif %}

## About scopes and permissions for package registries

{% data reusables.package_registry.packages-classic-pat-only %}

To use or manage a package hosted by a package registry, you must use a {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} with the appropriate scope, and your personal account must have appropriate permissions.

For example:
-  To download and install packages from a repository, your {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} must have the `read:packages` scope, and your user account must have read permission.
- {% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %}To delete a package on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, your {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} must at least have the `delete:packages` and `read:packages` scope. The `repo` scope is also required for repo-scoped packages. For more information, see "[Deleting and restoring a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-and-restoring-a-package)."{% elsif ghae %}To delete a specified version of a package on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, your {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} must have the `delete:packages` and `repo` scope. For more information, see "[Deleting and restoring a package](/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-and-restoring-a-package)."{% endif %}

| Scope | Description | Required permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`read:packages`| Download and install packages from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} | read |
|`write:packages`| Upload and publish packages to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} | write |
| `delete:packages` | {% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %} Delete packages from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} {% elsif ghae %} Delete specified versions of packages from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} {% endif %} | admin |
| `repo` | Upload and delete packages (along with `write:packages`, or `delete:packages`) | write or admin |

When you create a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow, you can use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to publish and install packages in {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} without needing to store and manage a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}.

For more information, see:{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
- "[Configuring a packageâ€™s access control and visibility](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility)"{% endif %}
- "[Publishing and installing a package with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows/publishing-and-installing-a-package-with-github-actions)"
- "[Creating a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}](/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token/)"
- "[Available scopes](/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/#available-scopes)"

## About repository transfers

You can transfer a repository to another user or organization account. For more information, see "[Transferring a repository](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository)."

When you transfer a repository, {% ifversion packages-registries-v2 %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} may transfer the packages associated with the repository, depending on the registry the packages belong to.

- For registries that support granular permissions, packages are scoped to a user or organization account, and the account associated with the package does not change when you transfer a repository. If you have linked a package to a repository, the link is removed when you transfer the repository to another user, and any codespaces or {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows associated with the repository will lose access to the package. For the list of these registries, see "[Granular permissions for user/organization-scoped packages](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."
- For registries that only support repository-scoped permissions, packages are published directly to repositories, and {% endif %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} transfers the packages associated with a repository as part of the repository transfer. All billable usage associated with the packages will subsequently be billed to the new owner. If the previous repository owner is removed as a collaborator on the repository, they may no longer be able to access the packages associated with the repository.{% ifversion packages-registries-v2 %} For the list of these registries, see "[Permissions for repository-scoped packages](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."{% endif %}

## Maintaining access to packages in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows

To ensure your workflows will maintain access to your packages, ensure that you're using the right access token in your workflow and that you've enabled {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} access to your package.

For more conceptual background on {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} or examples of using packages in workflows, see "[Managing GitHub Packages using GitHub Actions workflows](/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows)."

### Access tokens  

- To publish packages associated with the workflow repository, use `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- To install packages associated with other private repositories that `GITHUB_TOKEN` can't access, use a {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %}

For more information about `GITHUB_TOKEN` used in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows, see "[Authentication in a workflow](/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
### {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} access for container images

To ensure your workflows have access to your container image, you must enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} access to the repositories where your workflow is run. You can find this setting on your package's settings page. For more information, see "[Ensuring workflow access to your package](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility#ensuring-workflow-access-to-your-package)."
