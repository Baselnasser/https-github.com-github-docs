## Tests

It's not strictly necessary to run tests locally while developing: You can
always open a pull request and rely on the CI service to run tests for you,
but sometimes it's helpful to run tests locally before pushing your changes to
GitHub.

Test are written using [jest](https://ghub.io/jest), a framework maintained
by Facebook and used by many teams at GitHub. Jest is convenient in that it
provides everything: a test runner, an assertion library, code coverage analysis,
custom reporters for different types of test output, etc.

### Running all the tests

Once you've followed the development instructions above, you can run the entire
test suite locally:

```sh
script/test # or `npm test`
```

### Watching all the tests

You can also run a script that will continually watch for changes and
re-run the tests any time a change is made. This command will notify you
when tests change to and from a passing or failing state, and will also print
out a test coverage report, so you can see what files are in need of tests.

```sh
npm run test-watch
```

### Testing individual files

If you're making changes to a specific file and don't want to run the entire
test suite, you can pass an argument to the `jest` testing tool:

```sh
jest __tests__/page.js
```

The argument doesn't have to be a fully qualified file path. It can also be a
portion of a filename:

```sh
jest page # runs tests on __tests__/page.js and __tests__/pages.js
```

### Linting

To validate all your JavaScript code (and auto-format some easily reparable mistakes),
run the linter:

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Broken link test

This test checks all internal links and image references in the English site. To run it locally (takes about 60 seconds):

```sh
npx jest links-and-images
```
It checks images, anchors, and links for every **version** of every **page**.

It reports five types of problems:

1. **Broken image references**
    * Example: `/assets/images/foo.png` where `foo.png` doesn't exist.
2. **Broken same-page anchors**
    * Example: `#foo` where the page does not have a heading `Foo`.
3. **Broken links due to page not found**
    * Example: `/github/using-git/foo` where there is no `foo.md` file at that path.
4. **Broken links due to versioning**
    * Example: an unversioned link to a Dotcom-only article in a page that has Enterprise versions.
5. **Broken anchors on links**
    * Example: `/some/valid/link#bar` where the linked page can be found but it does not have a heading `Bar`.

{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-github-hosted-runners %}
{% data reusables.actions.ae-beta %}
{% data reusables.actions.ae-self-hosted-runners-notice %}

### Introduction

In this guide, you'll create a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow to test your code and then publish it to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}.

### Publishing your package

1. Create a new repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, adding the `.gitignore` for Node. {% if currentVersion ver_lt "enterprise-server@3.1" %} Create a private repository if you’d like to delete this package later, public packages cannot be deleted.{% endif %} For more information, see "[Creating a new repository](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)."
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```shell
    $ git clone https://{% if currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}<em>YOUR-HOSTNAME</em>{% else %}github.com{% endif %}/<em>YOUR-USERNAME</em>/<em>YOUR-REPOSITORY</em>.git
    $ cd <em>YOUR-REPOSITORY</em>
    ```
3. Create an `index.js` file and add a basic alert to say "Hello world!"
    {% raw %}
    ```javascript{:copy}
    alert("Hello, World!");
    ```
    {% endraw %}
4. Initialize an npm package with `npm init`. In the package initialization wizard, enter your package with the name: _`@YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`_, and set the test script to `exit 0`. This will generate a `package.json` file with information about your package.
    {% raw %}
    ```shell
    $ npm init
      ...
      package name: <em>@YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY</em>
      ...
      test command: <em>exit 0</em>
      ...    
    ```
    {% endraw %}

5. Run `npm install` to generate the `package-lock.json` file, then commit and push your changes to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
    ```shell
    $ npm install
    $ git add index.js package.json package-lock.json
    $ git commit -m "initialize npm package"
    $ git push
    ```
6. Create a `.github/workflows` directory. In that directory, create a file named `release-package.yml`.
7. Copy the following YAML content into the `release-package.yml` file{% if currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}, replacing `YOUR-HOSTNAME` with the name of your enterprise{% endif %}.
    ```yaml{:copy}
    name: Node.js Package

    on:
      release:
        types: [created]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
            with:
              node-version: 12
          - run: npm ci
          - run: npm test

      publish-gpr:
        needs: build
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@3.1" or currentVersion == "github-ae@next" %}
        permissions:
          packages: write
          contents: read{% endif %}
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
            with:
              node-version: 12
              registry-url: {% if currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}https://npm.YOUR-HOSTNAME.com/{% else %}https://npm.pkg.github.com/{% endif %}
          - run: npm ci
          - run: npm publish
            env:
              NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${% raw %}{{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}{% endraw %}
    ```
8. Commit and push your changes to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
    ```shell
    $ git add .github/workflows/release-package.yml
    $ git commit -m "workflow to publish package"
    $ git push
    ```
9.  The workflow that you created will run whenever a new release is created in your repository. If the tests pass, then the package will be published to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}.
    
    To test this out, navigate to the **Code** tab in your repository and create a new release. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)."

### Viewing your published package

You can view all of the packages you have published.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.package_registry.packages-from-code-tab %}
{% data reusables.package_registry.navigate-to-packages %}


### Installing a published package

Now that you've published the package, you'll want to use it as a dependency across your projects. For more information, see "[Working with the npm registry](/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#installing-a-package)."

### Next steps

The basic workflow you just added runs any time a new release is created in your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}. You can publish your package to multiple registries with a single workflow, trigger the workflow to run on different events such as a merged pull request, manage containers, and more.

Combining {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}:
