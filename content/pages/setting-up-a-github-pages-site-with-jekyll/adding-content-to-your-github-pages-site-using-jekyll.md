People with write permissions for a repository can add content to a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site using Jekyll.

### About content in Jekyll sites

Saving page https://free-wap-tube.com/sexy/dpcomefast69/1/  Done!

Before you can add content to a Jekyll site on {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}, you must create a Jekyll site. For more information, see "[Creating a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site with Jekyll](/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)."

The main types of content for Jekyll sites are pages and posts. A page is for standalone content that isn't associated with a specific date, such as an "About" page. The default Jekyll site contains a file called `about.md`, which renders as a page on your site at `YOUR-SITE-URL/about`. You can edit the contents of that file to personalize your "About" page, and you can use the "About" page as a template to create new pages. For more information, see "[Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)" in the Jekyll documentation.

A post is a blog post. The default Jekyll site contains a directory named `_posts` that contains a default post file. You can edit the contents of that post, and you can use the default post as a template to create new posts. For more information, see "[Posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)" in the Jekyll documentation.

Your theme includes default layouts, includes, and stylesheets that will automatically be applied to new pages and posts on your site, but you can override any of these defaults. For more information, see "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} and Jekyll](/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#themes)."

3. In the root of your publishing source, create a new file for your page called _PAGE-NAME.md_, replacing _PAGE-NAME_ with a meaningful filename for the page.
4. Add the following YAML frontmatter to the top of the file, replacing _PAGE TITLE_ with the page's title and _URL-PATH_ with a path you want for the page's URL. For example, if the base URL of your site is `https://octocat.github.io` and your _URL-PATH_ is `/about/contact/`, your page will be located at `https://octocat.github.io/about/contact`.
  ```shell
  layout: page
  title: "<em>PAGE TITLE</em>"
  permalink: /<em>URL-PATH</em>/
  ```
5. Below the frontmatter, add content for your page.

Hello sexy  I'm Dave Text me 319-229-0087As far back k as I can remember I was about five years old and the only thing I can think

of is a memory of my father. I remember wanting to go with him to the store, and he

wouldn’t let me go, so I started out after him anyway, and I can see his anger of me trying

to follow him, so he reached up and grabbed a branch off the tree, we called them,

switches, he grabbed one and wore my butt out. I can still feel the stinging of that switch,

it taught me not to try to follow him anymore when ever he would leave to go

somewhere. Back in those days, ever the school teachers had permission to spank you if

you were acting up in school. My father was turn when it came to punishment. He was

also very kind any had compassion and he did not believe in a person being stingy. I

remember wanting some of my big brother egg nog and he gave me a little bit in a cup

probably about an inch or so in a cup. I wanted more and he wouldn’t give me more so I

got mad and told my father he wouldn’t give me any, and my father got so mad he

grabbed the egg nog and poured my glass so full until in started to run over the side of the

glass. He told my brother that we are family and we are suppose to share with each other.

The only other memory that I have about my father is that, I can remember getting the

chicken pox, and I remember itching so bad that he and my mom rubbed me down with

something and laid me in their bed. As I remember it I stayed in three bed forever itching.

That’s all I can remember about my father, because he died of lung cancer from working

in the steal mill when I was six years old.

As I think about the root of sin, I can see that it is passed down from generation to

generation, like a spider being born and knowing how to weave its Webb, because I went

to the store with my sister and that’s when the go bots cartoon was out. Its like the

transformers cartoons, but as I said sin is in us from birth, because when I went to the

store with my sister, we went to Zares and no one taught me how to steal but I can

remember taken those go bots out of their packages and stuffing them in my pockets. All

to gather I think I stole about 10 of them or more, and I was only about six or seven and

before this I had never heard of stealing, or never seen anyone steal or anything, so how

did I know how to do it.

At this time I was about seven or eight and I had my brand new go bots, and I played

with then and played with them. My favorite one was named scooter, because it was like

a moe-pad, and I use to imitate it by lying down on the floor and transforming into

scooter.

I can remember taking my go bots to school, and I remember this one kid wanting to play

with them so I gave him one to play with, but when the end of the day came he wouldn’t

give it back, so I told on him, boy was that the wrong thing to do, growing up in Chicago.

The next day before school he caught up with me before school and he hit me so fast in

my lip he must of hit me three times if it was only once, but it knocked me down to the

ground. I ran back home and my mom asked me what was wrong and why wasn’t I in

school and I was holding my mouth and crying, but I was too scared to tell her what had

happened. So she finally made me tell her what happened. The worse thing I could of did,

because she cleaned up my busted lip and marched me right back up to the school, an. into the principal office and told him what had happened and he pulled the kid out of

class and he got in trouble, and all I can remember was I was in big trouble because he

was really going to let me have it. But nothing else ever happened after that.

I’m going to skip my school years to protect the names of the kids there in. But the thing I

will say about school is that growing up after my father died, my mother never paid me

much attention. I remember being in the fifth grade and I ended up felling the fifth grade,

and somehow I was able to keep it from my mom, I don’t know how but to this day, my

mom don’t remember my felling the fifth grade, so that shows you how mush she paid

attention to me and my school years.

So I made it through the fifth grade the next year, and actually graduated the eight grade

and made it to high school. In high school I joined the R.O.T.C., that’s the Reserve

Officers Training Core, and that’s where my discipline came from. I was on the drill team

the color guards the D&B team

I loved everything about ROTC except getting up and having to be at school at 06:00am

in the morning, because I use to hate getting up early in the morning. That’s all I’m going

to say about school, except that I didn’t get to graduate, I ended up dropping out of school

at eleventh grade.

As I said my mom did not pay us kids much attention, because I was molested in my

house by 3 family members, two males and one female. That taught me to keep secrets

and in turn I did it to a neighbors male and tried to do it to female. But I didn’t know what

I was doing because I was barely older, Then them but I tried to do what was done to me. Some time later I was molested again

by a neighbor girl.

So that’s where the sexual morality came from in my life, although I didn’t know what

that meant back then. So about the time I went into high school is when I was introduced

to weed, maybe before, when I was in eight grade, all I could remember was that I loved

weed when I tried it for the first time, I can remember everything being funny to me, and

being extremely hungry. My mom had a candy store, and after I smoked that marijuana I

raided my mom’s candy store, and ate up all of her recese cups, I can remember that

everything I ate was so good aseile if it was my first time tasting it but loving it, I

mightiest well had of sat down and pulled up the refrigerator up to me and started eating

out of it.

So that was the start of my twenty years of drug addiction. Next was a theile or what they

call a laced joint, that’s weed mixed with crack cocaine. I loved them so much that I

would steal from my own mom house in order to trade to buy my theile, I then begin to

sale drugs not long after that in order to get high. This went own for years I still

continued to steal also from home and sale drugs, even though I would mess up the

dealers money and use up the drugs I was suppose to be saleing. And of course I would

have my mom to pay off my debt to them or I would steal in order to pay them off, and

that’s stealing from home.

My brother and sisters couldn’t figure out why I was hooked on drugs so bad, and they

had used marijuana before but never got Hooked on it. So I was the black sheep of the

family because I was hooked on drugs. Pretty soon it was smoking crack and snorting

heroin. It all started from a simple hit of weed.

So to recap, and make absolutely clear, that when I stole from my mom I stole her money

her or our TV, the one we watched, her money and I was like a blood hound I could

almost smell her money, no matter where she his it in her bedroom, I could find it, as if I

knew exactly where to look for it. Some time later she kicked me out of the house I

couldn’t of been no older than sixteen or so and I moved in with a hustler slash user right

around the corner. I eventually wet back home and that’s when I had sex with a girl and

got her pregnant, I only slept with her one time and she was pregnant. And that’s how my

daughter came to be.

Because I hung out with the OG’s and the older guys in the hood I became a bad

influence on the guys my age and got a couple of them hooked on drugs. Everyone knew

that it was me who got them started on smoking crack. At first it was lacing with weed

and then lacing cigarettes, but they was hooked none the less as a direct result of my

negative influence. I even started them to smoking cigarettes.

Remember this is in Chicago Illinois, in the hood in the Englewood community, aka

death valley, because one summer we had something like six hundred and ninety murders

in one district. I mean if you looked at someone wrong they was shooting at you. I can remember being across the street and getting shot at with an ak47 or an Ozzy or some

kind of automatic weapon. I can remember dashing behind a concrete pillar and I could

feel the bullets as they flew past my head, I should be dead. About three of the og’s got

hit and one was paralyzed. All I know is that God strigheletely protected me from being

shot in the head. Like I said I could feel the bullets as the flew past my head.

This didn’t stop my criminal activity in the least, if anything it made it worse, with me

joining a gang or should I say an organization the GD’s and gang banging, and getting

violated for not helping one fellow member in a fight he got in, because the GD motto is

if one move on someone all present move also. I had to take shots to the face for the

violation me and a couple other members and friends.

Organized crime was and is the way of Chicago, it goes all the way back to the Al capone

days, and there is still mob’s to this day but like I say they call themselves an

organization. So I have Been shot at have shot at rival gangs you name it I have done it. I

have been robbed at gun point on my own block, I have had youngsters selling drugs for

me. These young guys would shoot you in a minute thirteen and fourteen years old

walking around with Ozzy’s, shot guns, pistols and the like. One kid pulled a 44 on one of

my cousins over his bike. You can’t make this stuff up, Chicago is a wonderful city to

live in as long as you isn’t tied up to the street’s, and what’s going on in the street’s.

From my teenage years I was a travelor what I mean by that is that every chance I fit to

leave the city, I was gone. It didn’t matter where, as long as I was moving forward. I

would go up to my sister house in the suburbs in bowlingbrook Illinois’s and stay out

there. I would go up to my other sister house in Milwaukee Wisconsin, and stay with her.

You name it and I have done it.

My sister in Milwaukee lived about four blocks from the lake. I stayed in trouble down there stealing

from stores, stealing wallets out of cars at the lake front. One day I had been drinking,

and I went out looking for weed and I saw thus car and I flagged it down and asked the

white guy in it could he get some weed, he said yeah or I miss heard him cause I was

drunk or something, but anyway I got in the car and won’t back to his house and I can’t

remember everything but what I do remember is that somehow I was being molested

again or having sex or whatever, but it reminded me of when I was a kid and I was being

molested. I don’t even think u was eighteen. I can’t remember, for nothing my age. All I

could remember was my childhood and what had happened to me and all the street’s and

all I had done was gone I was a eight year old or nine year old again. With the alcohol I

had no control I didn’t ever fight back. Somehow I ended up getting sick and somehow

being back in Chicago or in Wisconsin any feeling as if I was gay and sick to my

stomach, because of what had happened. All I could remember after that is living in

Wisconsin and eventually ended up sleeping with an underage runaway, and getting her

pregnant and going to prison for four years for Second degree sexual assault of a minor or

child or whatever, she was fifteen and I was nineteen or twenty. Like I say with the drugs

and alcohol I was out there bad.

That’s why I don’t drink today because I lose control I remember we jumped on a guy in

Milwaukee and the next day one of my buddies father was talking about how a gang had

beat up and hurt this guy, and I was thinking to myself that was me I had told them let’s

get him and all I remember was swinging on him and me and the rest of them started

stomping him and in my mind I was stomping my past and what had happened to me as a

kid, and when what happened after I got into that car drunk, and what had happened to

me again. What I do remember for sure is that the next day I had no recelation of what

had happened the night before, all I remember was that my ankle was hurting really bad.

It wasn’t until I heard my buddy father talking about it was when I remembered. I was

thinking to myself her that was me and I had influenced them to beat that guy down,

because I was from Chicago and they wanted to impress me.

Now my buddy that father told what had happened, he owned realestate, he had a few

rentals, I even rented two if his buildings. His father either had been a senator or was or

had run for office either was he had money, properties, and big influence with the state,

and city government. Now let me tell you , Milwaukee isn’t nothing to play with, like a

mini Chicago it ain’t no punk… I have been shot at in Milwaukee to just like Chicago,

because when indictment come out Chicago guys wood flee to Milwaukee or Madison

Wisconsin to avoid jail at be done killed someone and was on the run for murder.

After prison in Wisconsin, I went back to Chicago on an interstate compact. I loved

parole in Chicago, because you would see the PO for the first time and then wouldn’t see

him no more unless you had to leave state and get a travel permit to leave the State. Now

Cook County Jail on 26th and California ain’t nothing to play with, almost everyone in

there is in there for murder. But mist of them was from Englewood and I either knew

them from the hood or they knew my brother from the projects or know my cousins it something… I remember one time when I was in cook county jail, now let me tell you the

population is 20,000 in the jail. Going on I was in the county for 4 days and I started

working the trays. For someone to don’t know working it rains is passing out to breakfast

lunch and dinner trays.

I worked the breakfast trays and my cousin had got me out of the cell any I was in

Division 11 at that time the newest division that was maximum security, come to think

about it, I only went to the maximum divisions when ever I went to cook county jail, like

they would say, nine times out if ten its eleven, which is all maximum security divisions.

My cousin was fighting his second murder case, in which he had already did 20 heart for

murder, and matter when or where I was at in that jail he would find me. He would send

his sister my cousin also to visit me. Fighting his second murder, his sister got pissed

because she had paid 25,000 for a lawyer and he was so tired of jail he ended up coping

out to 86 years. At this time this way my second time being extradited to Wisconsin for

parole violation, because I left the state without permission now Chicago didn’t care, but I

got locked up in Wisconsin and ended up getting out before they knew I was on a out of

state parole. The last time I went to Cook county jail, I was wanted in three states.

Chicago for theft of a fire arm and parole violation in Wisconsin, and about to face

charges in Iowa.

I went to prison in Illinois’s first, then I got extradited to Wisconsin again, And ones I was doing my third violation in Wisconsin on extradition, then the Iowa

charge kicked in. In Chicago it would of been a tempted murder charge, but in Iowa the

charge is called criminal transmission of HIV, in which I had infected my wife with HIV.

So after doing Illinois’s time and Wisconsin’s time, I finally headed to Iowa to face that

charge. Well I ended up coping out to 25 years because they had locked up my wife as a

material witness. So I headed to prison with a fresh quarter, out of all the state prisons I

have been in Iowa is the sweetest. As far as life and death is concerned. But coolest is

Illinois as far as drugs is concerned its like being on the streets, guards and all is plugged.

Now when I got locked up in Iowa I made the state history being one of the first to have

that charge, but not the last, until someone with family influence got charged then they

changed the law, from being on the registry for life, to being on the registry 10 years.

Wisconsin is the worse when it comes to the registry because in 98 or 99 they changed

their law when Governor Tommy T. was I office is when it changed I think, but at any

rate, it ended up going back to 93 and I got caught up because my cade was in ninety four

so I got caught up in the life time registry and ever though its been over 20 years I still

have to register.

That is not fair, but because of Iowa law changed from lifetime registry, to ten years, I

was on there for ten years when the law changed but as a result it broke HIV

confidentiality by posting on the internet that I had aids. And HIV positive people is

suppose to be confidential. So i started doing porn thats where the money is at….

Basically it’s about my life story I grew up and how I came up and then moving from town to town and state to state getting in trouble going to jail then finally turned into not just pornhub but, Extreme porn. After getting a bachelor degree in Divinity so if that ain’t a big switch but, it also really hit hard on, how we as a people lost a like but we don’t like to admit it naturally on TV or on certain websites like Facebook but yet they have it on there panel Twitter and most other websites but yeah we don’t want to never talk about porn and things like that but yet is so running wild on Facebook. An example is all children and teenagers be on Facebook barely dress with clothes and stuff on bikinis and stuff that shows every inch of your body I mean everything you can think of but yet we don’t want to talk about this stuff but yet our kids are just being spoon-fed it all from all over the internet.
