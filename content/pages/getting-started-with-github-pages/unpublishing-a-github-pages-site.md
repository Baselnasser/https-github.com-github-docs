When you unpublish your site, your current deployment is removed and the site will no longer be available. Any existing repository settings or content will not be affected.

Unpublishing a site does not permanently delete the site. For information on deleting a site, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/deleting-a-github-pages-site)."

## Unpublishing a user or organization site

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
2. Delete the branch that you're using as a publishing source, or delete the entire repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#deleting-a-branch)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository)."

## Re-enabling a site that has been unpublished

Unpublishing your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site removes your current deployment. To make your site available again, you can create a new deployment.

{% ifversion pages-custom-workflow %}

### Re-enable using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

A successful workflow run in the repository for your site will create a new deployment. Trigger a workflow run to redeploy your site.

### Re-enabling your site when publishing from a branch

1. Configure your publishing source to publish from a branch of your choosing. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch)."
1. Commit to your publishing source to create a new deployment.

{% else %}

### Re-enabling a project site

1. Configure your publishing source to publish from a branch of your choosing. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch)."
1. Commit to your publishing source to create a new deployment.

### Re-enabling a user or organization site

Because your publishing source was deleted during unpublishing, you will need to create a new publishing source and configure a new {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch)."
