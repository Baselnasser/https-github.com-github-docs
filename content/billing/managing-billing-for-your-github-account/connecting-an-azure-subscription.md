## About Azure subscriptions

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.billing-azure-subscription %} For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions)," "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-packages/about-billing-for-github-packages)," and "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot)."

{% ifversion ghec %}
{% note %}

**Note:** If your enterprise account is on a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, connecting an Azure subscription is the only way to use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} beyond the included amounts, or to use {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %} at all.

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}
After you connect an Azure subscription, you can also manage your spending limits.
