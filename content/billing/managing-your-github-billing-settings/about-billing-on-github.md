## Managing billing settings

{% data reusables.sponsors.paypal-deprecation %}

You must manage billing settings, payment method, and paid features and products for each of your accounts separately. You can choose to pay monthly or yearly for each account's paid products and features. Every paid feature or product associated with an account shares a billing date, payment method, and receipt.

{% data reusables.dotcom_billing.payment-methods %} {% data reusables.dotcom_billing.same-payment-method %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}For qualifying metered or consumption-based services, you may choose to pay for the services from your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account or from an Azure subscription. The terms of the billing method you choose will apply to services billed in this manner.{% endif %}

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings)."
