## About re-running workflows and jobs

Re-running a workflow{% ifversion re-run-jobs %} or jobs in a workflow{% endif %} uses the same `GITHUB_SHA` (commit SHA) and `GITHUB_REF` (Git ref) of the original event that triggered the workflow run. {% ifversion actions-stable-actor-ids %}The workflow will use the privileges of the actor who initially triggered the workflow, not the privileges of the actor who initiated the re-run. {% endif %}You can re-run a workflow{% ifversion re-run-jobs %} or jobs in a workflow{% endif %} for up to 30 days after the initial run.{% ifversion not ghae %}{% ifversion re-run-jobs %} You cannot re-run jobs in a workflow once its logs have passed their retention limits. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy)."{% endif %}{% endif %}{% ifversion debug-reruns %} When you re-run a workflow or jobs in a workflow, you can enable debug logging for the re-run. This will enable runner diagnostic logging and step debug logging for the re-run. For more information about debug logging, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)."{% endif %}

## Re-running all the jobs in a workflow

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.4 or ghae or ghec -%}
1. In the upper-right corner of the workflow, re-run jobs.

   - If any jobs failed, select the **{% octicon "sync" aria-hidden="true" %} Re-run jobs** dropdown menu and click **Re-run all jobs**.

   - If no jobs failed, click **Re-run all jobs**.
{%- endif %}
{% ifversion ghes < 3.5 or ghae -%}
1. In the upper-right corner of the workflow, select the **Re-run jobs** dropdown menu and click **Re-run all jobs**.
{%- endif %}

{% endwebui %}

{% data reusables.cli.cli-learn-more %}

To re-run a failed workflow run, use the `run rerun` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the failed run that you want to re-run.  If you don't specify a `run-id`, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent failed run.

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID
```

{% ifversion debug-reruns %}
{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging-cli %}

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID --debug
```

{% endif %}

To view the progress of the workflow run, use the `run watch` subcommand and select the run from the interactive list.

```shell
gh run watch
```

{% endcli %}

{% ifversion re-run-jobs %}
## Re-running failed jobs in a workflow

If any jobs in a workflow run failed, you can re-run just the jobs that failed. When you re-run failed jobs in a workflow, a new workflow run will start for all failed jobs and their dependents. Any outputs for any successful jobs in the previous workflow run will be used for the re-run. Any artifacts that were created in the initial run will be available in the re-run. Any environment protection rules that passed in the previous run will automatically pass in the re-run.

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
1. In the upper-right corner of the workflow, select the **{% octicon "sync" aria-hidden="true" %} Re-run jobs** dropdown menu, and click **Re-run failed jobs**.
{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging %}

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

To re-run failed jobs in a workflow run, use the `run rerun` subcommand with the `--failed` flag. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the run for which you want to re-run failed jobs. If you don't specify a `run-id`, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent failed run.

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID --failed
```

{% ifversion debug-reruns %}
{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging-cli %}

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID --failed --debug
```

{% endif %}
{% endcli %}

## Re-running a specific job in a workflow

When you re-run a specific job in a workflow, a new workflow run will start for the job and any dependents. Any outputs for any other jobs in the previous workflow run will be used for the re-run. Any artifacts that were created in the initial run will be available in the re-run. Any environment protection rules that passed in the previous run will automatically pass in the re-run.

{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
1. Next to the job that you want to re-run, click {% octicon "sync" aria-label="The re-run icon" %}.

{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging %}

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

To re-run a specific job in a workflow run, use the `run rerun` subcommand with the `--job` flag. Replace `job-id` with the ID of the job that you want to re-run.

```shell
gh run rerun --job JOB_ID
```

{% ifversion debug-reruns %}
{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging-cli %}

```shell
gh run rerun --job JOB_ID --debug
```

{% endif %}
{% endcli %}

## Reviewing previous workflow runs

You can view the results from your previous attempts at running a workflow. You can also view previous workflow runs using the API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions#get-a-workflow-run)."

{%- ifversion re-run-jobs %}
1. To the right of the run name, select the **Latest** dropdown menu and click a previous run attempt.
