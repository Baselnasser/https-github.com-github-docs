```yaml{:copy}
on:
```
</td>
<td>

The `on` keyword lets you define the events that trigger when the workflow is run. You can define multiple events here. For more information, see "[Triggering a workflow](/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#using-events-to-trigger-workflows)."
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
  workflow_dispatch:
```
</td>
<td>

Add the `workflow_dispatch` event if you want to be able to manually run this workflow in the UI. For more information, see [`workflow_dispatch`](/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
  pull_request:
```
</td>
<td>

Add the `pull_request` event, so that the workflow runs automatically every time a pull request is created or updated. For more information, see [`pull_request`](/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
  push:
    branches:
      - gh-readonly-queue/main/**
```
</td>
<td>

Add the `push` event, so that the workflow runs automatically every time a commit is pushed to a branch matching the filter `gh-readonly-queue/main/**`. For more information, see [`push`](/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read
```
</td>
<td>

Modifies the default permissions granted to `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This will vary depending on the needs of your workflow. For more information, see "[Assigning permissions to jobs](/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs)."
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```yaml{:copy}
concurrency:
  group: {% raw %}'${{ github.workflow }} @ ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.label || github.head_ref || github.ref }}'{% endraw %}
```
</td>
<td>

Creates a concurrency group for specific events, and uses the `||` operator to define fallback values. For more information, see "[Using concurrency](/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency)."
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
</td>
<td>

Cancels any currently running job or workflow in the same concurrency group.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
jobs:
```
</td>
<td>

Groups together all the jobs that run in the workflow file.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
  test:
```
</td>
<td>

Defines a job with the ID `test` that is stored within the `jobs` key.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
    runs-on: {% raw %}${{ fromJSON('["ubuntu-latest", "self-hosted"]')[github.repository == 'github/docs-internal'] }}{% endraw %}
```
</td>
<td>

Configures the job to run on a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner or a self-hosted runner, depending on the repository running the workflow. In this example, the job will run on a self-hosted runner if the repository is named `docs-internal` and is within the `github` organization. If the repository doesn't match this path, then it will run on an `ubuntu-latest` runner hosted by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information on these options see "[Choosing the runner for a job](/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job)."
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
    timeout-minutes: 60
```
</td>
<td>

Sets the maximum number of minutes to let the job run before it is automatically canceled. For more information, see [`timeout-minutes`](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes).
</td>

```
</td>

  This section defines the build matrix for your jobs.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
      fail-fast: false
```
</td>

Setting `fail-fast` to `false` prevents {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} from cancelling all in-progress jobs if any matrix job fails.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
      matrix:

            meta,
            rendering,
            routing,

            linting,
            translations,
          ]
```
</td>
<td>

Creates a matrix named `test-group`, with an array of test groups. These values match the names of test groups that will be run by `npm test`.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
    steps:
```
</td>
<td>

Groups together all the steps that will run as part of the `test` job. Each job in a workflow has its own `steps` section.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
      - name: Check out repo
        uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}

          persist-credentials: 'false'
```
</td>
<td>

The `uses` keyword tells the job to retrieve the action named `actions/checkout`. This is an action that checks out your repository and downloads it to the runner, allowing you to run actions against your code (such as testing tools). You must use the checkout action any time your workflow will run against the repository's code or you are using an action defined in the repository. Some extra options are provided to the action using the `with` key.

          mv docs-early-access/data data/early-access
          rm -r docs-early-access
```
</td>

If the current repository is the `github/docs-internal` repository, this step uses the `run` keyword to execute shell commands to move the `docs-early-access` repository's folders into the main repository's folders.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
      - name: Checkout LFS objects

```
</td>
<td>

This step uses the `trilom/file-changes-action` action to gather the files changed in the pull request, so they can be analyzed in the next step. This example is pinned to a specific version of the action, using the `a6ca26c14274c33b15e6499323aac178af06ad4b` SHA.

          cache: npm
```
</td>
<td>

This step uses the `actions/setup-node` action to install the specified version of the `node` software package on the runner, which gives you access to the `npm` command.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml{:copy}
      - name: Install dependencies

          key: {% raw %}${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('package*.json') }}{% endraw %}
```
</td>
<td>

This step uses the `actions/cache` action to cache the Next.js build, so that the workflow will attempt to retrieve a cache of the build, and not rebuild it from scratch every time. For more information, see "[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)."
</td>

        run: npm test -- {% raw %}tests/${{ matrix.test-group }}/{% endraw %}
```
</td>
<td>

This step runs the tests using `npm test`, and the test matrix provides a different value for {% raw %}`${{ matrix.test-group }}`{% endraw %} for each job in the matrix. It uses the `DIFF_FILE` environment variable to know which files have changed, and uses the `CHANGELOG_CACHE_FILE_PATH` environment variable for the changelog cache file.
