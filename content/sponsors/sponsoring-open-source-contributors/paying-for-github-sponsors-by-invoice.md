Companies can use an invoice method to participate in the {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} program. Companies paying by invoice get access to a {% data variables.product.product_name %} dashboard that measures open source contributions and activity across the public projects on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} they're interested in.

Companies paying by invoice will be invoiced separately for their {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} payments and their other payments to GitHub. Payments to {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} are invoiced through Stripe.
