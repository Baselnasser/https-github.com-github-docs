Organizations can use an invoice method to participate in the {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} program. A minimum spend of 5,000 US dollars per year on sponsoring is required to be invoiced for sponsorships.

When an organization pays by invoice, they will not be charged the 3% credit card processing fee that applies to sponsorships from organization accounts. For more information about sponsorship fees, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/sponsoring-an-open-source-contributor#sponsorship-fees)."

Sign up to pay by invoice by contacting {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}.

Organizations paying by invoice will be invoiced separately for their {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} payments and their other payments to {% data variables.product.company_short %}. Organizations can be invoiced for sponsorships and pay via credit card for other payments to {% data variables.product.company_short %}. 

## Understanding your Sponsors invoice

Payments to {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} are invoiced through Stripe.

Sponsors will receive an invoice by email from Stripe, Inc. This invoice is separate from the one you receive for {% data variables.product.product_name %} services, and may have a different payment date.
