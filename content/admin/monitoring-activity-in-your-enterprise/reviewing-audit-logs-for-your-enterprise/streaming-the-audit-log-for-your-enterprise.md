## About audit log streaming

To help protect your intellectual property and maintain compliance for your organization, you can use streaming to keep copies of your audit log data and monitor:
{% data reusables.audit_log.audited-data-list %}

The benefits of streaming audit data include:

* **Data exploration**. You can examine streamed events using your preferred tool for querying large quantities of data. The stream contains both audit events and Git events across the entire enterprise account.{% ifversion pause-audit-log-stream %}
* **Data continuity**. You can pause the stream for up to seven days without losing any audit data.{% endif %}
* **Data retention**. You can keep your exported audit logs and Git events data as long as you need to.

Enterprise owners can set up{% ifversion pause-audit-log-stream %}, pause,{% endif %} or delete a stream at any time. The stream exports the audit and Git events data for all of the organizations in your enterprise.

## Setting up audit log streaming

You set up the audit log stream on {% data variables.product.product_name %} by following the instructions for your provider.

- [Amazon S3](#setting-up-streaming-to-amazon-s3)
- [Azure Blob Storage](#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-blob-storage)
- [Azure Event Hubs](#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-event-hubs)
- [Google Cloud Storage](#setting-up-streaming-to-google-cloud-storage)
- [Splunk](#setting-up-streaming-to-splunk)

### Setting up streaming to Amazon S3

{% ifversion streaming-oidc-s3 %}
You can set up streaming to S3 with access keys or, to avoid storing long-lived secrets in {% data variables.product.product_name %}, with OpenID Connect (OIDC).

- [Setting up streaming to S3 with access keys](#setting-up-streaming-to-s3-with-access-keys)
- [Setting up streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect](#setting-up-streaming-to-s3-with-openid-connect)
- [Disabling streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect](#disabling-streaming-to-s3-with-openid-connect)

#### Setting up streaming to S3 with access keys
{% endif %}

To stream audit logs to Amazon's S3 endpoint, you must have a bucket and access keys. For more information, see [Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html) in the the AWS documentation. Make sure to block public access to the bucket to protect your audit log information. 

To set up audit log streaming from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} you will need:
* The name of your Amazon S3 bucket
* Your AWS access key ID
* Your AWS secret key

For information on creating or accessing your access key ID and secret key, see [Understanding and getting your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) in the AWS documentation.

{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

{% ifversion streaming-oidc-s3 %}
#### Setting up streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect

1. In AWS, add the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC provider to IAM. For more information, see [Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.

   - For the provider URL, use `https://oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com`.
   - For "Audience", use `sts.amazonaws.com`.
1. Create a bucket, and block public access to the bucket. For more information, see [Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html) in the AWS documentation.
1. Create a policy that allows {% data variables.product.company_short %} to write to the bucket. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} requires only the following permissions.

   ```
   {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
         {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
               "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
        }
      ]
   }
   ```
   For more information, see [Creating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the AWS documentation.
1. Configure the role and trust policy for the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} IdP. For more information, see [Creating a role for web identity or OpenID Connect Federation (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.
  
   - Add the permissions policy you created above to allow writes to the bucket.
   - Edit the trust relationship to add the `sub` field to the validation conditions, replacing `ENTERPRISE` with the name of your enterprise.
     ```
     "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
           "oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
           "oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com:sub": "https://github.com/ENTERPRISE"
         }
      }
      ```
   - Make note of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the created role.
{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
{% data reusables.audit_log.streaming-choose-s3 %}
1. Under "Authentication", click **OpenID Connect**.

   ![Screenshot of the authentication options for streaming to Amazon S3](/assets/images/help/enterprises/audit-log-streaming-s3-oidc.png)
1. Configure the stream settings.

   - Under "Bucket", type the name of the bucket you want to stream to. For example, `auditlog-streaming-test`.
   - Under "ARN Role" type the ARN role you noted earlier. For example, `arn:aws::iam::1234567890:role/github-audit-log-streaming-role`.
{% data reusables.audit_log.streaming-check-s3-endpoint %}
{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

#### Disabling streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect

If you want to disable streaming to S3 with OIDC for any reason, such as the discovery of a security vulnerability in OIDC, delete the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC provider you created in AWS when you set up streaming. For more information, see [Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.

Then, set up streaming with access keys until the vulnerability is resolved. For more information, see "[Setting up streaming to S3 with access keys](#setting-up-streaming-to-s3-with-access-keys)."

{% endif %}

### Setting up streaming to Azure Blob Storage

### Setting up streaming to Google Cloud Storage

To set up streaming to Google Cloud Storage, you must create a service account in Google Cloud with the appropriate credentials and permissions, then configure audit log streaming in {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the service account's credentials for authentication.

1. Create a service account for Google Cloud. You do not need to set access controls or IAM roles for the service account. For more information, see [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. Create a JSON key for the service account, and store the key securely. For more information, see [Creating and managing service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. If you haven't created a bucket yet, create the bucket. For more information, see [Creating storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. Give the service account the Storage Object Creator role for the bucket. For more information, see [Using Cloud IAM permissions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add) in the Google Cloud documentation.
{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Select the Configure stream drop-down menu and click **Google Cloud Storage**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Configure stream" drop-down menu](/assets/images/help/enterprises/audit-stream-choice-google-cloud-storage.png)

### Setting up streaming to Splunk

To stream audit logs to Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint you must make sure that the endpoint is configured to accept HTTPS connections. For more information, see [Set up and use HTTP Event Collector in Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) in the Splunk documentation.

{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Click **Configure stream** and select **Splunk**.
   
   ![Choose Splunk from the drop-down menu](/assets/images/help/enterprises/audit-stream-choice-splunk.png)

1. On the configuration page, enter:
   * The domain on which the application you want to stream to is hosted.
  
     If you are using Splunk Cloud, `Domain` should be `http-inputs-<host>`, where `host` is the domain you use in Splunk Cloud. For example: `http-inputs-mycompany.splunkcloud.com`. 

   * The port on which the application accepts data.<br>

     If you are using Splunk Cloud, `Port` should be `443` if you haven't changed the port configuration. If you are using the free trial version of Splunk Cloud, `Port` should be `8088`.

   * A token that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can use to authenticate to the third-party application.
  
   ![Enter the stream settings](/assets/images/help/enterprises/audit-stream-add-splunk.png)

1. Leave the **Enable SSL verification** check box selected.

    Audit logs are always streamed as encrypted data, however, with this option selected, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} verifies the SSL certificate of your Splunk instance when delivering events. SSL verification helps ensure that events are delivered to your URL endpoint securely. You can clear the selection of this option, but we recommend you leave SSL verification enabled.
1. Click **Check endpoint** to verify that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can connect and write to the Splunk endpoint.
