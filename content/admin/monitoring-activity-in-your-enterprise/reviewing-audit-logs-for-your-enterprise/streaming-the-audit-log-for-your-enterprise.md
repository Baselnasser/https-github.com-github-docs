## About audit log streaming

To help protect your intellectual property and maintain compliance for your organization, you can use streaming to keep copies of your audit log data and monitor:
{% data reusables.audit_log.audited-data-list %}

The benefits of streaming audit data include:

* **Data exploration**. You can examine streamed events using your preferred tool for querying large quantities of data. The stream contains both audit events and Git events across the entire enterprise account.{% ifversion pause-audit-log-stream %}
* **Data continuity**. You can pause the stream for up to seven days without losing any audit data.{% endif %}
* **Data retention**. You can keep your exported audit logs and Git events data as long as you need to.

Enterprise owners can set up{% ifversion pause-audit-log-stream %}, pause,{% endif %} or delete a stream at any time. The stream exports the audit and Git events data for all of the organizations in your enterprise.

{% note %}

**Note:** All audit logs are streamed in JSON format.

{% endnote %}

## Setting up audit log streaming

You set up the audit log stream on {% data variables.product.product_name %} by following the instructions for your provider.

- [Amazon S3](#setting-up-streaming-to-amazon-s3)
- [Azure Blob Storage](#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-blob-storage)
- [Azure Event Hubs](#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-event-hubs){% ifversion streaming-datadog %}

{% ifversion streaming-oidc-s3 %}
#### Setting up streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect

1. In AWS, add the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC provider to IAM. For more information, see [Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.

   - For the provider URL, use `https://oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com`.
   - For "Audience", use `sts.amazonaws.com`.
{% data reusables.audit_log.create-s3-bucket %}
{% data reusables.audit_log.create-s3-policy %}
1. Create a bucket, and block public access to the bucket. For more information, see [Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html) in the AWS documentation.
1. Create a policy that allows {% data variables.product.company_short %} to write to the bucket by copying the following JSON and replacing `EXAMPLE-BUCKET` with the name of your bucket. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} requires only the permissions in this JSON.

   ```
   {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
         {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
               "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*"
        }
      ]
   }
   ```
   For more information, see [Creating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the AWS documentation.
4. Configure the role and trust policy for the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} IdP. For more information, see [Creating a role for web identity or OpenID Connect Federation (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.

   - Add the permissions policy you created above to allow writes to the bucket.
   - Edit the trust relationship to add the `sub` field to the validation conditions, replacing `ENTERPRISE` with the name of your enterprise.
     ```
     "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
           "oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
           "oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com:sub": "https://github.com/ENTERPRISE"
         }
      }
      ```
   - Make note of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the created role.
{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
{% data reusables.audit_log.streaming-choose-s3 %}
1. Under "Authentication", click **OpenID Connect**.
2. Configure the stream settings.

   - Under "Bucket", type the name of the bucket you want to stream to. For example, `auditlog-streaming-test`.
   - Under "ARN Role" type the ARN role you noted earlier. For example, `arn:aws::iam::1234567890:role/github-audit-log-streaming-role`.
{% data reusables.audit_log.streaming-check-s3-endpoint %}
{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

#### Disabling streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect

If you want to disable streaming to S3 with OIDC for any reason, such as the discovery of a security vulnerability in OIDC, delete the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC provider you created in AWS when you set up streaming. For more information, see [Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.

Then, set up streaming with access keys until the vulnerability is resolved. For more information, see "[Setting up streaming to S3 with access keys](#setting-up-streaming-to-s3-with-access-keys)."

{% endif %}

#### Integrating with AWS CloudTrail Lake
You can consolidate your audit logs from {% data variables.product.product_name %} with AWS activity logs by integrating audit log streaming to S3 with AWS CloudTrail Lake. For additional information, see the [AWS CloudTrail Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) or the [GitHub Audit Log to CloudTrail Open Audit](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cloudtrail-lake-github-audit-log) in the `aws-samples/aws-cloudtrail-lake-github-audit-log` repository.

### Setting up streaming to Azure Blob Storage

Before setting up a stream in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you must first have created a storage account and a container in Microsoft Azure. For details, see the Microsoft documentation, "[Introduction to Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)."

To configure the stream in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} you need the URL of a SAS token.

**On Microsoft Azure portal**:
1. On the Home page, click **Storage Accounts**.
1. Under "Name", click the name of the storage account you want to use.
1. Under "Data storage", click **Containers**.
1. Click the name of the container you want to use.
1. In the left sidebar, under "Settings", click **Shared access tokens**.

1. Select the **Configure stream** dropdown menu and click **Datadog**.

2. In the **Token** field, paste the token you copied earlier.

3. Select the **Site** dropdown menu and click your Datadog site. To determine your Datadog site, compare your Datadog URL to the table in [Datadog sites](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/) in Datadog Docs.

4. To verify that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can connect and write to the Datadog endpoint, click **Check endpoint**.

{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}
1. After a few minutes, confirm that audit log data is appearing on the **Logs** tab in Datadog. If audit log data is not appearing, confirm that your token and site are correct in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
{% endif %}

### Setting up streaming to Google Cloud Storage

To set up streaming to Google Cloud Storage, you must create a service account in Google Cloud with the appropriate credentials and permissions, then configure audit log streaming in {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the service account's credentials for authentication.

1. Create a service account for Google Cloud. You do not need to set access controls or IAM roles for the service account. For more information, see [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. Create a JSON key for the service account, and store the key securely. For more information, see [Creating and managing service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. If you haven't created a bucket yet, create the bucket. For more information, see [Creating storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. Give the service account the Storage Object Creator role for the bucket. For more information, see [Using Cloud IAM permissions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add) in the Google Cloud documentation.
{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Select the **Configure stream** dropdown menu and click **Google Cloud Storage**.

2. Under "Bucket", type the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

### Setting up streaming to Splunk

To stream audit logs to Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint you must make sure that the endpoint is configured to accept HTTPS connections. For more information, see [Set up and use HTTP Event Collector in Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) in the Splunk documentation.

{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Select the **Configure stream** dropdown menu and click **Splunk**.

2. On the configuration page, enter:
   * The domain on which the application you want to stream to is hosted.

     If you are using Splunk Cloud, `Domain` should be `http-inputs-<host>`, where `host` is the domain you use in Splunk Cloud. For example: `http-inputs-mycompany.splunkcloud.com`.

   * The port on which the application accepts data.<br>

     If you are using Splunk Cloud, `Port` should be `443` if you haven't changed the port configuration. If you are using the free trial version of Splunk Cloud, `Port` should be `8088`.

   * A token that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can use to authenticate to the third-party application.

3. Leave the **Enable SSL verification** check box selected.

    Audit logs are always streamed as encrypted data, however, with this option selected, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} verifies the SSL certificate of your Splunk instance when delivering events. SSL verification helps ensure that events are delivered to your URL endpoint securely. You can clear the selection of this option, but we recommend you leave SSL verification enabled.
4. Click **Check endpoint** to verify that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can connect and write to the Splunk endpoint.
{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

{% ifversion pause-audit-log-stream %}
## Pausing audit log streaming

Pausing the stream allows you to perform maintenance on the receiving application without losing audit data. Audit logs are stored for up to seven days on {% data variables.location.product_location %} and are then exported when you unpause the stream.

{% ifversion streaming-datadog %}
Datadog only accepts logs from up to 18 hours in the past. If you pause a stream to a Datadog endpoint for more than 18 hours, you risk losing logs that Datadog won't accept after you resume streaming.
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. To the right of your configured stream, click **Pause stream**.

2. A confirmation message is displayed. Click **Pause stream** to confirm.

When the application is ready to receive audit logs again, click **Resume stream** to restart streaming audit logs.
