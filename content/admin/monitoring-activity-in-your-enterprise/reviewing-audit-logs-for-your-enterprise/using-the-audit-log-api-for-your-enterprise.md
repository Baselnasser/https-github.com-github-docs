## Using the audit log API

You can interact with the audit log using the REST API.{% ifversion read-audit-scope %} You can use the `read:audit_log` scope to access the audit log via the API.{% endif %}

Timestamps and date fields in the API response are measured in [UTC epoch milliseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

To ensure your intellectual property is secure, and you maintain compliance for your enterprise, you can use the audit log REST API to keep copies of your audit log data and monitor:
{% data reusables.audit_log.audited-data-list %}

{% data reusables.audit_log.retention-periods %}

For more information about the audit log REST API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/enterprise-admin#audit-log)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/orgs#get-the-audit-log-for-an-organization)."

## Example 1: All events in an enterprise, for a specific date, with pagination

You can use {% ifversion ghes %}page-based{% else %}cursor based{% endif %} pagination. For more information about pagination, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

{% ifversion ghes %}

The query below searches for audit log events created on Jan 1st, 2022 in the `avocado-corp` enterprise, and return the first page with a maximum of 100 items per page using pagination. For more information about pagination, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
--request GET \
"https://api.github.com/enterprises/avocado-corp/audit-log?phrase=created:2022-01-01&page=1&per_page=100"
```

{% else %}

The query below searches for audit log events created on Jan 1st, 2022 in the `avocado-corp` enterprise, and returns the first page with a maximum of 100 items per page using pagination. For more information about pagination, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)." The `--include` flag causes the headers to be returned along with the response.

```
curl --include -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
--request GET \
"https://api.github.com/enterprises/avocado-corp/audit-log?phrase=created:2022-01-01&per_page=100"
```

If there are more than 100 results, the `link` header will include URLs to fetch the next, first, and previous pages of results.

```
link: <https://api.github.com/enterprises/13827/audit-log?%3A2022-11-01=&per_page=100&after=MS42NjQzODMzNTk5MjdlKzEyfDloQzBxdURzaFdVbVlLWjkxRU9mNXc%3D&before=>; rel="next",
<https://api.github.com/enterprises/13827/audit-log?%3A2022-11-01=&per_page=100&after=&before=>; rel="first",
<https://api.github.com/enterprises/13827/audit-log?%3A2022-11-01=&per_page=100&after=&before=MS42Njc4NDA2MjM4MzNlKzEyfExqeG5sUElvNEZMbG1XZHA5akdKTVE%3D>; rel="prev"
```

Copy the corresponding pagination link into your next request. For example:

```shell
curl -I -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
--request GET \
"https://api.github.com/enterprises/13827/audit-log?%3A2022-11-01=&per_page=100&after=MS42Njc4NDA2MjM5NDFlKzEyfHRYa3AwSkxUd2xyRjA5bWxfOS1RbFE%3D&before="
```

{% endif %}

## Example 2: Events for pull requests in an enterprise, for a specific date and actor

You can specify multiple search phrases, such as `created` and `actor`, by separating them in your formed URL with the `+` symbol or ASCII character code `%20`.

The query below searches for audit log events for pull requests, where the event occurred on or after Jan 1st, 2022 in the `avocado-corp` enterprise, and the action was performed by the `octocat` user:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
--request GET \
"https://api.github.com/enterprises/avocado-corp/audit-log?phrase=action:pull_request+created:>=2022-01-01+actor:octocat"
```
