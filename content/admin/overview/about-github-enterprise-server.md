## About deployment topologies

By default, {% data variables.product.product_name %} runs as a standalone instance. You can increase the reliability and performance of {% data variables.product.product_name %} by using a different topology for your deployment.

- To mitigate the impact of system or network failures, you can deploy a passive replica instance. During an outage that affects your primary instance, you can manually fail over to the replica instance. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability/about-high-availability-configuration)."
- You can configure multiple active replicas to improve performance for developers who are geographically distant from your primary instance. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability/about-geo-replication)."
- Some enterprises with tens of thousands of developers may benefit from a cluster configuration that scales horizontally instead of vertically. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-clustering/about-clustering)."

## About backups and disaster recovery

To safeguard against data loss or service disruptions for your developers, {% data variables.product.company_short %} strongly recommends that you establish a plan for disaster recovery. You can back up your instance's configuration and user data by deploying and configuring a Linux or Unix host system with {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance)."

Additionally, you can configure a passive replica instance to fail over to in the event of a system or network failure. For more information, see "[About deployment topologies](#about-deployment-topologies)."
