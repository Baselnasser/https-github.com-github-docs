{% tip %}

**Note:** If [LDAP Sync is enabled](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap#enabling-ldap-sync) and the `Administrators group` attribute is set when [configuring LDAP access for users](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap#configuring-ldap-with-your-github-enterprise-server-instance), those users will automatically have site administrator access to your instance. In this case, you can't manually promote users with the steps below; you must add them to the LDAP administrators group.

{% endtip %}

For information about promoting a user to an organization owner, see the `ghe-org-admin-promote` section of "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-org-admin-promote)."
