## About the list of people in your enterprise

To audit access to your enterprise's resources and manage license usage, you can see a list of all the people who have access to your enterprise.

You can see all current enterprise members and enterprise administrators{% ifversion ghec %}, as well as pending invitations to become members and administrators{% endif %}. To make it easier to consume this information, you can search and filter the lists.

{% ifversion ghec %}

If {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} is configured for your enterprise, when you filter a list of people in your enterprise, the following limitations apply.

- The filter for two-factor authentication (2FA) status does not show people who only have an account on a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance.
- If you combine the filter for accounts on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instances with either the filter for organizations or 2FA status, you will not see any results.

For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, see the following articles.

- "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-server@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/about-github-connect)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} documentation
- "[AUTOTITLE](/github-ae@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/about-github-connect)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %} documentation

{% endif %}

{% ifversion enterprise-member-csv %}
You can also export membership information for your enterprise. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/exporting-membership-information-for-your-enterprise)."
{% endif %}

## Viewing enterprise administrators

You can view all the current enterprise owners{% ifversion ghec %} and billing managers{% endif %} for your enterprise.{% ifversion enterprise-membership-view-improvements %} You can see useful information about each administrator{% ifversion ghec %} and filter the list by role{% endif %}.{% endif %} You can find a specific person by searching for their username or display name.

{% ifversion ghes > 3.5 %}
Enterprise owners whose accounts are suspended are included in the list of enterprise administrators, and are identified as suspended. You should consider demoting any suspended owners you see. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/promoting-or-demoting-a-site-administrator#demoting-a-site-administrator-from-the-enterprise-settings)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion not ghae %}
You can also remove an administrator. For more information. see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/inviting-people-to-manage-your-enterprise#removing-an-enterprise-administrator-from-your-enterprise-account)."
{% endif %}

## Viewing members {% ifversion enterprise-membership-view-improvements %}{% else %}and outside collaborators{% endif %}

You can see all the current members {% ifversion enterprise-membership-view-improvements %}{% else %}or outside collaborators{% endif %} for your enterprise. You can see useful information about each account and filter the list in useful ways, such as by role. You can find a specific person by searching for their username or display name.

You can view more information about the person's access to your enterprise, such as the organizations the person belongs to, by clicking on the person's name.

{% ifversion remove-enterprise-members %}
You can also remove any enterprise member from all organizations owned by the enterprise. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/removing-a-member-from-your-enterprise)."
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.people-tab %}{% ifversion enterprise-membership-view-improvements %}{% else %}
1. Optionally, to view a list of outside collaborators rather than the list of members, under "Members", click **Outside collaborators**.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec %}

## Viewing members' email addresses

You may be able to view the email addresses for members of your enterprise on either {% data variables.location.product_location %} or an external identity system. The visibility of the email addresses depends on your enterprise's authentication method, domains, and potentially the member's user profile configuration.

- If you use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} and the `NameID` for your SAML configuration is an email address, you can view the `NameID` for each of your enterprise members.

- If you verify a domain for your enterprise, you can view members' email addresses for the verified domain.

- If you don't use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, and you also don't configure SAML single sign-on (SSO), members access your enterprise's resources on {% data variables.location.product_location %} solely using a personal account. {% data reusables.saml.personal-accounts-determine-email-visibility %}

If you use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, verify a domain, or configure SAML SSO for your enterprise, you may be able to view the email addresses in one or more of the following ways.

1. On your SAML Identity Provider (IdP), review the email addresses of users with access to {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/about-saml-for-enterprise-iam)."
1. Export the membership report for your enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. The report may contain the user's email address, stored as the following values.

   - `GitHub com saml name`: The `NameID` from the user's linked SAML identity, which is typically the user's email address (for more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/saml-configuration-reference)")
   - `GitHub com verified domain emails`: Email addresses for any verified domains (for more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise)")

   For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/exporting-membership-information-for-your-enterprise)."
{% data reusables.saml.use-api-to-get-externalidentity %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion enterprise-membership-view-improvements %}
## Viewing outside collaborators

You can see all the current outside collaborators for your enterprise. You can see useful information about each collaborator and filter the list in useful ways, such as by organization. You can find a specific collaborator by searching for their username or display name.

You can view more information about the person's access to your enterprise, such as a list of all the repositories the collaborator has access to, by clicking on the person's name.

## Viewing pending invitations

You can see all the pending invitations to become members, administrators, or outside collaborators in your enterprise. You can filter the list in useful ways, such as by license, by organization, or by source. You can find a specific person by searching for their username or display name.

In the list of pending members, for any individual account, you can cancel all invitations to join organizations owned by your enterprise. This does not cancel any invitations for that same person to become an enterprise administrator or outside collaborator.

{% note %}

**Note:** If an invitation was provisioned via SCIM, you must cancel the invitation via your identity provider (IdP) instead of on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

{% endnote %}

If you use {% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_ghe %}, the list of pending invitations includes all {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} subscribers that haven't joined any of your organizations on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, even if the subscriber does not have a pending invitation to join an organization. For more information about how to get {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} subscribers access to {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-licenses-for-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise/setting-up-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise)."

## Viewing suspended members in an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}

If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you can view suspended users. Suspended users are members who have been deprovisioned after being unassigned from the {% data variables.product.prodname_emu_idp_application %} application or deleted from the identity provider. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users)."

{% ifversion ghec %}If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you{% elsif ghes or ghae %}You{% endif %} can filter the member list of an organization by type to determine if memberships are managed through an IdP or managed directly. Memberships managed through an IdP were added through an IdP group, and the IdP group was connected to a team within the organization. Memberships managed directly were added to the organization manually. The way a membership is mananaged in an organization determines how it must be removed. You can use this filter to determine how members were added to an organization, so you know how to remove them.{% ifversion ghec %} For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users#about-organization-membership-management)."{% endif %}
