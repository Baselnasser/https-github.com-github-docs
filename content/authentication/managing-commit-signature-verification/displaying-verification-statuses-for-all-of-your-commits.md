The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.
