{% ifversion not ghae %}
## Requesting a new password

1. To request a new password, visit {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/password_reset{% else %}`https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/password_reset`{% endif %}.
1. Enter the email address associated with your account on {% ifversion ghae %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% else %}{% data variables.location.product_location %}{% endif %}, then click **Send password reset email.** The email will be sent to the backup email address if you have one configured.
1. We'll email you a link that will allow you to reset your password. You must click on this link within 3 hours of receiving the email. If you didn't receive an email from us, make sure to check your spam folder.
1. If you have enabled two-factor authentication, you will be prompted for your 2FA credentials:
{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
   * If you have {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}, you will be sent a push notification to verify your identity. Open the push notification or the {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} app and enter the two-digit code shown to you on the password reset page in your browser.
      * To skip using GitHub Mobile to verify, click **Enter two-factor authentication or recovery code**.
{% endif %}
   * Type your authentication code or one of your recovery codes and click **Verify**.
     * If you have added a security key to your account, click **Use security key** instead of typing an authentication code.
     {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
     * If you have set up [{% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}](https://github.com/mobile), click **Authenticate with GitHub Mobile** instead.
     {% endif %}
1. In the text field under **Password**, type a new password. Then, in the text field under **Confirm password**, type the password again.
1. Click **Change password**. For help creating a strong password, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-strong-password)."

{% tip %}

To avoid losing your password in the future, we suggest using a secure password manager, like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/).

{% endtip %}

## Changing an existing password

{% data reusables.repositories.blocked-passwords %}

1. {% data variables.product.signin_link %} to {% data variables.product.product_name %}.
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.security %}
1. Under "Change password", type your old password, a strong new password, and confirm your new password. For help creating a strong password, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-strong-password)"
1. Click **Update password**.

{% tip %}

For greater security, enable two-factor authentication in addition to changing your password. See [About two-factor authentication](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication) for more details.

{% endtip %}
{% endif %}
## Updating your access tokens

See "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations)" for instructions on reviewing and deleting access tokens. To generate new access tokens, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)."

{% ifversion not ghae %}

If you have reset your account password and would also like to trigger a sign-out from the {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} app, you can revoke your authorization of the "GitHub iOS" or "GitHub Android" OAuth App. This will sign out all instances of the {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} app associated with your account. For additional information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations)."

{% endif %}

## Updating your SSH keys

See "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-ssh-keys)" for instructions on reviewing and deleting SSH keys. To generate and add new SSH keys, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)."

## Resetting API tokens

If you have any applications registered with {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you'll want to reset their OAuth tokens. For more information, see the "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps#reset-an-authorization)" endpoint.
