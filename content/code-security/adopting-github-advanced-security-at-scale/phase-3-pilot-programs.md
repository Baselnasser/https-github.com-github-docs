## About pilot programs

We recommend you identify a few high-impact projects or teams to use in a pilot rollout of GHAS. This allows an initial group within your company to get familiar with GHAS and builds a solid foundation for GHAS before you roll it out to the remainder of your company.

The steps in this phase will help you enable GHAS on your enterprise, begin using its features, and review your results. If youâ€™re working with {% data variables.product.prodname_professional_services %}, they can provide additional assistance through this process through onboarding sessions, GHAS workshops, and troubleshooting as needed.

Before you start your pilot projects, we recommend that you schedule some meetings for your teams, such as an initial meeting, midpoint review, and a wrap-up session when the pilot is complete. These meetings will help you all make adjustments as needed and ensure your teams are prepared and supported to complete the pilot successfully.

{% ifversion ghes %}

If you haven't already enabled GHAS for your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance, see "[Enabling GitHub Advanced Security for your enterprise](/admin/advanced-security/enabling-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise)."

{% endif %}

You need to enable GHAS for each pilot project, either by enabling the GHAS features for each repository or for all repositories in any organizations taking part in the pilot. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)" or "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization)"

## Piloting {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}

{% ifversion ghes %}

To enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} on your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance, see "[Configuring code scanning for your appliance](/admin/advanced-security/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance)."

{% elsif ghae %}

To enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} you must make runners available to run workflows in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %}, see "[Getting started with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_managed %}](/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-ae)."

{% endif %}

You can run code scanning on a repository by creating a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow to run the [CodeQL action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/). {% ifversion ghec %}{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} uses [GitHub-hosted runners](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) by default, but this can be customized if you plan to host your own runner with your own hardware specifications. For more information, see "[About self-hosted runners](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners)."{% endif %}

For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see:
  - "[Learn GitHub Actions](/actions/learn-github-actions)"
  - "[Understanding GitHub Actions](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)"
  - "[Events that trigger workflows](/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows)"
  - "[Filter Pattern Cheat Sheet](/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet)"

We recommend enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} on a repository-by-repository basis as part of your pilot program. For more information, see "[Setting up code scanning for a repository](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository)."

If you want to enable code scanning for many repositories, you may want to script the process.

For an example of a script that opens pull requests to add a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow to multiple repositories, see the [`jhutchings1/Create-ActionsPRs`](https://github.com/jhutchings1/Create-ActionsPRs) repository for an example using PowerShell, or [`nickliffen/ghas-enablement`](https://github.com/NickLiffen/ghas-enablement) for teams who do not have PowerShell and instead would like to use NodeJS.

When running initial code scans, you may find that no results are found or that an unusual number of results are returned. You may want to adjust what is flagged in future scans. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning)."

If your company wants to use other third-party code analysis tools with GitHub code scanning, you can use actions to run those tools within GitHub. Alternatively, you can upload results, which are generated by third-party tools as SARIF files, to code scanning. For more information, see "[Integrating with code scanning](/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning)."

## Piloting {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}

GitHub scans repositories for known types of secrets, to prevent fraudulent use of secrets that were committed accidentally.

{% ifversion ghes %}

To enable secret scanning for your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance, see "[Configuring secret scanning for your appliance](/admin/advanced-security/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-appliance)."

{% endif %}

You need to enable secret scanning for each pilot project, either by enabling the feature for each repository or for all repositories in any organizations taking part in the project. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)" or "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization)."

If you have collated any custom patterns specific to your enterprise, especially any related to the projects piloting {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}, you can configure those. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."

To learn how to view and close alerts for secrets checked into your repository, see "[Managing alerts from secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning)."
