{% data reusables.code-scanning.enterprise-enable-code-scanning-actions %}

## Options for configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}

You decide how to generate {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts, and which tools to use, at a repository level. {% data variables.product.product_name %} provides fully integrated support for {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analysis, and also supports analysis using third-party tools. For more information, see the following bullets and "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning#about-tools-for-code-scanning)."

{% data reusables.code-scanning.enabling-options %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.4 or ghae > 3.4 or ghec %}
{% data reusables.code-scanning.about-multiple-configurations-link %}
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.code-scanning.codeql-action-version-ghes %}

{% ifversion code-scanning-tool-status-page %}

The {% data variables.code-scanning.tool_status_page %} shows useful information about all of your code scanning tools. If code scanning is not working as you'd expect, the {% data variables.code-scanning.tool_status_page %} is a good starting point for debugging problems. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page)."

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae %}
## Prerequisites

Before configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for a repository, you must ensure that there is at least one self-hosted {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} runner available to the repository.

Enterprise owners, organization and repository administrators can add self-hosted runners. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion code-scanning-without-workflow %}

## Configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} automatically

The default setup for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} will automatically configure {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} with the best settings for your repository. Default setup uses {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to run {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analysis without requiring you to commit a workflow file to your repository.

Your repository is eligible for default setup if it uses {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and contains only the following {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}-supported languages:{% ifversion code-scanning-default-setup-go %} Go, {% endif %}JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, or Ruby. While you can use default setup if your repository includes languages that aren't supported by CodeQL, such as R, you must use the advanced setup if you include {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}-supported languages other than those previously listed. For more information on {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}-supported languages, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql#about-codeql)."{% ifversion org-enable-code-scanning %} For information on bulk enablement, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale)."{% endif %}

Enabling default setup is the quickest way to configure {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for your repository. Additionally, default setup requires none of the maintenance necessary with a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workflow file. Before you enable default setup, you'll see the languages it will analyze, the query suites it will run, and the events that will trigger a new scan.

Try default setup if you don't need to run extra queries, change the scan schedule, or scan a language that is currently unsupported by default setup.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.security-analysis %}
1. In the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}" section, select **Set up** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %}, then click **Default**.

   ![Screenshot of the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}" section of "Code security and analysis" settings. The "Default setup" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/default-code-scanning-setup.png)

  You will then see a "{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} default configuration" dialog summarizing the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} configuration automatically created by the default setup.

{% ifversion code-scanning-without-workflow-310 -%}

1. Optionally, to customize your {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} setup, click {% octicon "pencil" aria-hidden="true" %} **Edit**.
   - To add or remove a language from the analysis performed by the default setup, select or deselect that language in the "Languages" section.
   - To specify the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query suite you would like to use, select your preferred query suite in the "Query suites" section.

{%- else -%}

1. Optionally, in the "Query suites" section of the "{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} default configuration" modal dialog, select the **Default** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} dropdown menu, then click the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query suite you would like to use.

   ![Screenshot of the default setup modal for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. A button labeled "Default", with an arrow indicating a dropdown menu, is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/security/default-setup-query-suite-dropdown.png)

  If you choose the **Extended** query suite, your {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} configuration will run lower severity and precision queries in addition to the queries included in the **Default** query suite.

  {% note %}

  **Note:** If you configure {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} to use the **Extended** query suite, you may experience a higher rate of false positive alerts.

  {% endnote %}

{% endif %}

1. Review the settings for the default setup on your repository, then click **Enable {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}**.

  {% note %}

  **Notes:**
     - If you would like to change which events will trigger a new scan or customize other {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} features not mentioned previously, you need to use the advanced setup. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#creating-an-advanced-setup)."
     - If you are switching to the default setup from the advanced setup, you will see a warning informing you that the default setup will override existing configurations. {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} default setup will disable the existing workflow file, and block any {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analysis API uploads.
     - If you would like to see your default {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} setup after configuration, select {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Menu" %}, then click {% octicon "gear" aria-hidden="true" %} **View {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} configuration**.

  {% endnote %}

## Creating an advanced setup

The advanced setup for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} is helpful when you need to customize your {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. By creating and editing a workflow file, you can choose which queries to run, change the scan schedule, scan any {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}-supported language, use a matrix build, and more.

{% endif %}

### Configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} manually

You can customize your {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} by creating and editing a workflow file. The advanced setup generates a basic workflow file for you to customize.

{% data reusables.code-scanning.billing %}

{% ifversion fpt %}
  {% note %}

  **Note:** You can configure {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for any public repository where you have write access.

  {% endnote %}
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.security-analysis %}
1. Scroll down to the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}" section, select **Set up** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %}, then click **Advanced**.

   {% note %}

   **Note:** If you are switching to the advanced {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} setup from the default setup, in the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}" section, select {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Menu" %}, then click {% octicon "workflow" aria-hidden="true" %} **Switch to advanced**. In the pop-up window that appears, click **Disable {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}**.

   {% endnote %}

   ![Screenshot of the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}" section of "Code security and analysis" settings. The "Advanced setup" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/advanced-code-scanning-setup.png)

1. To customize how {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} scans your code, edit the workflow.

   Generally, you can commit the {% data variables.code-scanning.codeql_workflow %} without making any changes to it. However, many of the third-party workflows require additional configuration, so read the comments in the workflow before committing.

   For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/customizing-code-scanning)."

1. Click **Commit changes...** to display the commit changes form.

   ![Screenshot of the form to create a new file. To the right of the file name, a green button, labeled "Commit changes...", is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/repository/start-commit-commit-new-file.png)
1. In the commit message field, type a commit message.
1. Choose whether you'd like to commit directly to the default branch, or create a new branch and start a pull request.
1. Click **Commit new file** to commit the workflow file to the default branch or click **Propose new file** to commit the file to a new branch.
1. If you created a new branch, click **Create pull request** and open a pull request to merge your change into the default branch.

In the suggested {% data variables.code-scanning.codeql_workflow %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} is configured to analyze your code each time you either push a change to the default branch or any protected branches, or raise a pull request against the default branch. As a result, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} will now commence.

The `on:pull_request` and `on:push` triggers for code scanning are each useful for different purposes. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/customizing-code-scanning#configuring-frequency)."

{% else %}

## Bulk configuration of {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}

You can configure {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} in many repositories at once using a script. If you'd like to use a script to raise pull requests that add a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow to multiple repositories, see the [`jhutchings1/Create-ActionsPRs`](https://github.com/jhutchings1/Create-ActionsPRs) repository for an example using PowerShell, or [`nickliffen/ghas-enablement`](https://github.com/NickLiffen/ghas-enablement) for teams who do not have PowerShell and instead would like to use NodeJS.

{% endif %}

## Viewing the logging output from {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}

After configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for your repository, you can watch the output of the actions as they run.

{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}

   You'll see a list that includes an entry for running the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} workflow. The text of the entry is the title you gave your commit message.

   ![Screenshot of the "All workflows" page. In the list of workflow runs is a run labeled "Create .github/workflows/codeql.yml."](/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-actions-list.png)

1. Click the entry for the run of the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} workflow.

1. Click the job name on the left. For example, **Analyze (LANGUAGE)**.

   ![Screenshot of the log output for the "Analyze (go)" job. In the left sidebar, under the "Jobs" heading, "Analyze (go)" is listed.](/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-logging-analyze-action.png)

1. Review the logging output from the actions in this workflow as they run.

1. Once all jobs are complete, you can view the details of any {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts that were identified. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."

## Understanding the pull request checks

Each {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} workflow you set to run on pull requests always has at least two entries listed in the checks section of a pull request. There is one entry for each of the analysis jobs in the workflow, and a final one for the results of the analysis.

The names of the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} analysis checks take the form: "TOOL NAME / JOB NAME (TRIGGER)." For example, for {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}, analysis of C++ code has the entry "{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} / Analyze (cpp) (pull_request)." You can click **Details** on a {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} analysis entry to see logging data. This allows you to debug a problem if the analysis job failed. For example, for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} analysis of compiled languages, this can happen if the action can't build the code.

![Screenshot showing an example of {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} pull request checks. Failure of CodeQL analysis for C++ is shown with a red cross.](/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-pr-checks.png)

When the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} jobs complete, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} works out whether any alerts were added by the pull request and adds the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %} results / TOOL NAME" entry to the list of checks. After {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} has been performed at least once, you can click **Details** to view the results of the analysis.

{% ifversion ghes < 3.5 %}
If you used a pull request to add {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} to the repository, you will initially see an "Analysis not found" message when you click **Details** on the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %} results / TOOL NAME" check.

![Screenshot of the details for a code scanning result. Under "GitHub Code Scanning / CodeQL" is the heading "1 analysis not found."](/assets/images/enterprise/3.4/repository/code-scanning-analysis-not-found.png)

The table lists one or more categories. Each category relates to specific analyses, for the same tool and commit, performed on a different language or a different part of the code. For each category, the table shows the two analyses that {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} attempted to compare to determine which alerts were introduced or fixed in the pull request.

For example, in the screenshot above, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} found an analysis for the merge commit of the pull request, but no analysis for the head of the main branch.

### Reasons for the "Analysis not found" message

After {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} has analyzed the code in a pull request, it needs to compare the analysis of the topic branch (the branch you used to create the pull request) with the analysis of the base branch (the branch into which you want to merge the pull request). This allows {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} to compute which alerts are newly introduced by the pull request, which alerts were already present in the base branch, and whether any existing alerts are fixed by the changes in the pull request. Initially, if you use a pull request to add {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} to a repository, the base branch has not yet been analyzed, so it's not possible to compute these details. In this case, when you click through from the results check on the pull request you will see the "Analysis not found" message.

There are other situations where there may be no analysis for the latest commit to the base branch for a pull request. These include:

* The pull request has been raised against a branch other than the default branch, and this branch hasn't been analyzed.

  To check whether a branch has been scanned, go to the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %} page, click the **Branch** drop-down and select the relevant branch.

  ![Choose a branch from the Branch drop-down menu.](/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-branch-dropdown.png)

  The solution in this situation is to add the name of the base branch to the `on:push` and `on:pull_request` specification in the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} workflow on that branch and then make a change that updates the open pull request that you want to scan.

* The latest commit on the base branch for the pull request is currently being analyzed and analysis is not yet available.

  Wait a few minutes and then push a change to the pull request to retrigger {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}.

* An error occurred while analyzing the latest commit on the base branch and analysis for that commit isn't available.

  Merge a trivial change into the base branch to trigger {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} on this latest commit, then push a change to the pull request to retrigger {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}.

{% endif %}
