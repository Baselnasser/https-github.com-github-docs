## About security risks in your code

You can use security overview to see which repositories and teams are free from any security alerts and which have unresolved security alerts. The "Security risk" page shows a summary and detailed information on which repositories in an organization {% ifversion security-overview-org-risk-coverage-enterprise %}or enterprise {% endif %}are affected by security alerts, with a breakdown of alert by severity. You can filter the view to show a subset of repositories using the "affected" and "unaffected" links, the links under "Open alerts", the "Teams" dropdown menu, and a search field in the page header. This view is a great way to understand the broader picture for a repository, team, or group of repositories because you can see security alerts of all types in one view.

![Screenshot of the header section of the "Security risk" view on the "Security" tab for an organization. The options for filtering are outlined in dark orange, including "affected"/"unaffected" links, "Teams" selector, and search field.](/assets/images/help/security-overview/security-risk-view-summary.png)

{% note %}

**Note:** It's important to understand that all repositories without open alerts are included in the set of unaffected repositories. That is, unaffected repositories include any repositories where the feature is not enabled, in addition to repositories that have been scanned and any alerts identified have been closed.

## Viewing enterprise-level code security risks

{% ifversion security-overview-org-risk-coverage-enterprise %}

You can view data for security alerts across organizations in an enterprise. {% data reusables.security-overview.information-varies-GHAS %}

{% tip %}

**Tip:** You can use the `org:` filter in the search field to filter the data by organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/filtering-alerts-in-security-overview)."
