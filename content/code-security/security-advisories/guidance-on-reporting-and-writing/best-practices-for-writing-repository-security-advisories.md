Anyone with admin permissions to a repository can create and edit a security advisory.

## About security advisories for repositories

{% data reusables.security-advisory.security-advisory-overview %} For more information, see "[About repository security advisories](/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories)."

## Best practices

We recommend you use the syntax used in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}, especially the version formatting, when you write a repository security advisory, or make a community contribution to a global security advisory.

If you follow the syntax for the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}, especially when you define affected versions:
- When you publish your repository advisory, we can add your advisory to the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} as a "{% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed" advisory, without needing to ask for more information.
- {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} will have the information to accurately identify repositories that are affected and send them {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} to notify them.
- Community members are less likely to suggest edits to your advisory to fix missing or incorrect information.

You add or edit a repository advisory using the _Draft security advisory_ form. For more information, see "[Creating a repository security advisory](/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory)." 

You suggest an improvement to an existing global advisory using the _Improve security advisory_ form. For more information, see "[Editing security advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database)."

### Ecosystem

You need to assign the advisory to one of our supported ecosystems using the **Ecosystem** field. For more information about the ecosystems we support, see "[Browsing security advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#github-reviewed-advisories)."

### Package name

We recommend that you use the **Package name** field to specify which packages are affected because package information is required for "{% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed" advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}. Package information is optional for repository-level security advisories, but including this information early simplifies the review process when you publish your security advisory.

### Affected versions

We recommend that you use the **Affected versions** field to specify which versions are affected because this information is required for "{% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed" advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}. Version information is optional for repository-level security advisories, but including this information early simplifies the review process when you publish your security advisory.

- A valid affected version string consists of one of the following:
   - A lower bound operator sequence.
   - An upper bound operator sequence.
   - Both an upper and lower bound operator sequence.
   - A specific version sequence using the equality (`=`) operator.
- Each operator sequence must be specified as the operator, a single space, and then the version.
   - Valid operators are `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, or `>=`.
   - The version must begin with a number followed by any number of numbers, letters, dots, dashes, or underscores (anything other than a space or comma)
   - When specifying both an upper and lower bound sequence, the lower bound must come first, followed by a comma and a single space, then the upper bound.
   {% note %}

   **Note:** Affected version strings cannot contain leading or trailing spaces.

   {% endnote %}

- Upper-bound operators can be inclusive or exclusive, i.e. `<=` or `<`, respectively.
- Lower-bound operators can be inclusive or exclusive, i.e. `>=` or `>`, respectively. However, if you publish your repository advisory, and we graduate your repository advisory into a global advisory, a different rule applies: lower-bound strings can only be inclusive, i.e. `>=`. The exclusive lower bound operator (`>`) is only allowed when the version is `0`, for example `> 0`.

  {% note %}

  **Notes:** The lower-bound limitation:
   - is due to incompatibilities with the OSV (Open Source Vulnerability) schema.
   - only applies when you make a suggestion on an existing advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}.

  {% endnote %}

- You cannot specify multiple affected version ranges in the same field, such as `> 2.0, < 2.3, > 3.0, < 3.2`.To specify more than one range, you must create a new **Affected products** section for each range, by clicking the **+ Add another affected product** button.

  ![Screenshot highlighting the button to use to add multiple affected version ranges](/assets/images/help/security/security-advisory-add-another-affected-product.png)
 - If the affected version range includes only a single upper or lower bound:
   - The implicit value is always `> 0` if the lower bound is not explicitly specified.
   - The implicit value is always infinity if the upper bound is not explicitly specified.
