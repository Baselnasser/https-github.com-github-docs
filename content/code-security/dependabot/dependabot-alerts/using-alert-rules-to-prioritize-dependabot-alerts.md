## About {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules
<!-- will need to review this procedural section for GHES -->

{% data reusables.dependabot.github-curated-alert-rules-beta %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules allow you to instruct {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} to automatically dismiss or reopen certain alerts, based on complex logic from a variety of contextual criteria.

When enabled, the built-in `Dismiss low impact alerts` rule auto-dismisses certain types of vulnerabilities that are found in npm dependencies used in development. These alerts cover cases that feel like false alarms to most developers as the associated vulnerabilities:
- Are unlikely to be exploitable in a developer (non-production or runtime) environment.
- May relate to resource management, programming and logic, and information disclosure issues.
- At worst, have limited effects like slow builds or long-running tests.
- Are not indicative of issues in production.

This {% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated `Dismiss low impact alerts` rule includes vulnerabilities relating to resource management, programming and logic, and information disclosure issues. For more information, see "[Publicly disclosed CWEs used by the Dismiss low impact rule](#publicly-disclosed-cwes-used-by-the-dismiss-low-impact-rule)."

Filtering out these low impact alerts allows you to focus on alerts that matter to you, without having to worry about missing potentially high-risk development-scoped alerts.

{% note %}

**Note:** Automatic dismissal of low impact development alerts is currently only supported for npm.

{% endnote %}

Whilst you may find it useful to auto-dismiss low impact alerts, you can still reopen auto-dismissed alerts, and filter to see which alerts have been auto-dismissed. For more information, see "[Managing automatically dismissed alerts](#managing-automatically-dismissed-alerts)."

Additionally, auto-dismissed alerts are still available for reporting and reviewing, and can be re-introduced as not having been dismissed if the alert metadata changes, for example:
- If you change the scope of a dependency from development to production.
- If {% data variables.product.company_short %} modifies certain metadata for the related advisory.

Auto-dismissed alerts are defined by the `resolution:auto-dismiss` close reason. Automatic dismissal activity is included in alert webhooks, REST and GraphQL APIs, and the audit log. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/dependabot/alerts)" in the REST API documentation, and the "`repository_vulnerability_alert` " section in "[Reviewing the audit log for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#repository_vulnerability_alert-category-actions)."

By default, {% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules are enabled on public repositories and disabled for private repositories. Administrators of private repositories can opt in by enabling alert rules for their repository. For more information, see "[Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules for your private repository](#enabling-dependabot-alert-rules-for-your-private-repository)."

## Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert rules for your private repository

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}You first need to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for the repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-dependabot-alerts#managing-dependabot-alerts-for-your-repository)."{% elsif ghes %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for your repository can be enabled or disabled by your enterprise owner. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise)."{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-code-security-and-analysis %}
1. Under "{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}", click **Dismiss low impact alerts**.

{% endif %}

## Managing automatically dismissed alerts
<!-- will need to review this procedural section for GHES -->

You can filter to see which alerts have been auto-dismissed, and you can reopen dismissed alerts.

{% note %}

**Note:** The {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} page defaults to showing open alerts. To filter and view auto-dismissed alerts, you must first clear the `is:open` default filter from the view.

{% endnote %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-security %}
1. To filter to see all closed alerts, click **{% octicon "check" aria-hidden="true" %} Closed**. Alternatively, use the `is:closed` filter query in the search bar.

   ![Screenshot of the "Dependabot Alerts" page. A button, labelled "Closed" is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/dependabot-alerts-closed-tab.png)

1. To see all auto-dismissed alerts, select **Closed as**, then in the dropdown menu, click **Auto-dismissed**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Dependabot Alerts" page. A button, labelled "Closed as" is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/dependabot-alerts-closed-as.png)

1. To reopen an auto-dismissed alert, to the left of the alert title, click the checkbox adjacent to the alert, then click **Reopen**.

## Publicly disclosed CWEs used by the Dismiss low impact rule

Along with the `ecosystem:npm` and `scope:development` alert metadata, we use the following {% data variables.product.company_short %}-curated Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) to filter out low impact alerts for the `Dismiss low impact alerts` rule. We regularly improve this list and vulnerability patterns covered by built-in rules.

### Resource Management Issues
