Your repository's {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} tab lists all open and closed {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.2 %} and corresponding {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %}{% endif %}. You can{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.4 or ghae-issue-5638 %} filter alerts by package, ecosystem, or manifest. You can also{% endif %} sort the list of alerts, and you can click into specific alerts for more details. For more information, see "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}](/code-security/supply-chain-security/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)."

## About updates for vulnerable dependencies in your repository

{% data variables.product.product_name %} generates {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} when we detect that your codebase is using dependencies with known vulnerabilities. For repositories where {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} are enabled, when {% data variables.product.product_name %} detects a vulnerable dependency in the default branch, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} creates a pull request to fix it. The pull request will upgrade the dependency to the minimum possible secure version needed to avoid the vulnerability.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.4 or ghae-issue-5638 %}You can sort and filter {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} with the dropdown menus in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} tab or by typing filters as `key:value` pairs into the search bar. The available filters are repository (for example, `repo:my-repository`), package (for example, `package:django`), ecosystem (for example, `ecosystem:npm`), manifest (for example, `manifest:webwolf/pom.xml`), state (for example, `is:open`), and whether an advisory has a patch (for example, `has: patch`).

Each {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert has a unique numeric identifier and the {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} tab lists an alert for every detected vulnerability. Legacy {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} grouped vulnerabilities by dependency and generated a single alert per dependency. If you navigate to a legacy {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert, you will be redirected to a {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} tab filtered for that package. {% endif %}

## About the detection of calls to vulnerable functions

{% data reusables.dependabot.vulnerable-calls-beta %}

When {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} tells you that your repository uses a vulnerable dependency, you need to determine what the vulnerable functions are and check whether you are using them. Once you have this information, then you can determine how urgently you need to upgrade to a secure version of the dependency. 

For supported languages, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} automatically detects whether you use a vulnerable function and adds the label "Vulnerable call" to affected alerts. You can use this information in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} view to triage and prioritize remediation work more effectively.

{% note %}

**Note:** During the beta release, this feature is available only for new Python advisories created *after* April 14, 2022, and for a subset of historical Python advisories. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} is working to backfill data across additional historical Python advisories, which are added on a rolling basis. Vulnerable calls are highlighted only on the {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} pages.

{% endnote %}

![Screenshot showing an alert with the "Vulnerable call" label](/assets/images/help/repository/dependabot-alerts-vulnerable-call-label.png)

You can filter the view to show only alerts where {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} detected at least one call to a vulnerable function using the `has:vulnerable-calls` filter in the search field.

For alerts where vulnerable calls are detected, the alert details page shows additional information:

- One or more code blocks showing where the function is used.
- An annotation listing the function itself, with a link to the line where the function is called.

## Reviewing and fixing vulnerable dependencies

It’s important to ensure that all of your dependencies are clean of any security weaknesses. When {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} discovers vulnerabilities in your dependencies, you should assess your project’s level of exposure and determine what remediation steps to take to secure your application.

If a patched version is available, you can generate a {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} pull request to update this dependency directly from a {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert. If you have {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} enabled, the pull request may be linked will in the Dependabot alert. 

In cases where a patched version is not available, or you can’t update to the secure version, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} shares additional information to help you determine next steps. When you click through to view a {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alert, you can see the full details of the security advisory for the dependency including the affected functions. You can then check whether your code calls the impacted functions. This information can help you further assess your risk level, and determine workarounds or if you’re able to accept the risk represented by the security vulnerability.

{% if dependabot-alerts-vulnerable-calls %}

For supported languages, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} detects calls to vulnerable functions for you. When you view an alert labeled as "Vulnerable call", the details include the name of the function and a link to the code that calls it. Often you will be able to take decisions based on this information, without exploring further.

{% endif %}

### Fixing vulnerable dependencies

1. View the details for an alert. For more information, see "[Viewing vulnerable dependencies](#viewing-vulnerable-dependencies)" (above).
{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.2 %}
1. If you have {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} enabled, there may be a link to a pull request that will fix the dependency. Alternatively, you can click **Create {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} security update** at the top of the alert details page to create a pull request.
  ![Create {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} security update button](/assets/images/help/repository/create-dependabot-security-update-button-ungrouped.png)
1. Optionally, if you do not use {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %}, you can use the information on the page to decide which version of the dependency to upgrade to and create a pull request to update the dependency to a secure version.
{% elsif ghes < 3.3 or ghae %}
1. You can use the information on the page to decide which version of the dependency to upgrade to and create a pull request to the manifest or lock file to a secure version.
{% endif %}
1. When you're ready to update your dependency and resolve the vulnerability, merge the pull request. 

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.2 %}
   Each pull request raised by {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} includes information on commands you can use to control {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}. For more information, see "[Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands)."
{% endif %}

### Dismissing {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}

If you schedule extensive work to upgrade a dependency, or decide that an alert does not need to be fixed, you can dismiss the alert. Dismissing alerts that you have already assessed makes it easier to triage new alerts as they appear.

1. View the details for an alert. For more information, see "[Viewing vulnerable dependencies](#viewing-vulnerable-dependencies)" (above).
1. Select the "Dismiss" dropdown, and click a reason for dismissing the alert.{% if reopen-dependabot-alerts %} Unfixed dismissed alerts can be reopened later.{% endif %}
   ![Choosing reason for dismissing the alert via the "Dismiss" drop-down](/assets/images/help/repository/dependabot-alert-dismiss-drop-down-ungrouped.png)

{% if reopen-dependabot-alerts %}

## Viewing and updating closed alerts

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-security %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-dependabot-alerts %}
1. To just view closed alerts, click **Closed**.
