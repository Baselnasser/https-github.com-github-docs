## About the dependency graph

{% data reusables.dependabot.about-the-dependency-graph %}  

For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
## About configuring the dependency graph 
To generate a dependency graph, {% data variables.product.product_name %} needs read-only access to the dependency manifest and lock files for a repository. The dependency graph is automatically generated for all public repositories and you can choose to enable it for private repositories. For more information on viewing the dependency graph, see "[Exploring the dependencies of a repository](/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository)."

{% ifversion ghes %} ## Enabling the dependency graph
{% data reusables.dependabot.ghes-ghae-enabling-dependency-graph %}{% endif %}{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

### Enabling and disabling the dependency graph for a private repository

{% data reusables.dependabot.enabling-disabling-dependency-graph-private-repo %}
{% endif %}

When the dependency graph is first enabled, any manifest and lock files for supported ecosystems are parsed immediately. The graph is usually populated within minutes but this may take longer for repositories with many dependencies. Once enabled, the graph is automatically updated with every push to the repository{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} and every push to other repositories in the graph{% endif %}.

{% ifversion ghes %}
{% ifversion dependency-submission-api %}{% data reusables.dependency-submission.dependency-submission-link %}{% endif %}
{% endif %}
