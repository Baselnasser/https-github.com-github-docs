## Synopsis

```shell{:copy}
codeql dataset measure --output=<file> [--threads=<num>] <options>... -- <dataset>
```

## Description

\[Plumbing] Collect statistics about the relations in a particular
dataset.

This command is typically only used when developing a CodeQL extractor,
after a change that affects the database schema and which therefore
needs to have an accompanying change to the statistics used by the query
optimizer.

## Primary options

#### `<dataset>`

\[Mandatory] Path to the raw QL dataset to measure.

#### `-o, --output=<file>`

\[Mandatory] The output file to which statistics should be written,
typically with a '.dbscheme.stats' extension.

#### `-j, --threads=<num>`

The number of concurrent threads to use.

Defaults to 1. You can pass 0 to use one thread per core on the machine,
or -*N* to leave *N* cores unused (except still use at least one
thread).

### Common options

#### `-h, --help`

Show this help text.

#### `-J=<opt>`

\[Advanced] Give option to the JVM running the command.

(Beware that options containing spaces will not be handled correctly.)

#### `-v, --verbose`

Incrementally increase the number of progress messages printed.

#### `-q, --quiet`

Incrementally decrease the number of progress messages printed.

#### `--verbosity=<level>`

\[Advanced] Explicitly set the verbosity level to one of errors,
warnings, progress, progress+, progress++, progress+++. Overrides `-v`
and `-q`.

#### `--logdir=<dir>`

\[Advanced] Write detailed logs to one or more files in the given
directory, with generated names that include timestamps and the name of
the running subcommand.

(To write a log file with a name you have full control over, instead
give `--log-to-stderr` and redirect stderr as desired.)
