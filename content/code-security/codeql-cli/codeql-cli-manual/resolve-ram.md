## Synopsis

```shell copy
codeql resolve ram [--ram=<MB>] <options>...
```

## Description

\[Deep plumbing] Prepare RAM options.

This deep plumbing command prepares appropriate command-line options to
start a subcommand that will execute a QL query evaluator. It knows
appropriate heuristics for deciding whether to keep some of the
configured memory outside the Java heap.

In particular, this should be used to find appropriate `-J-Xmx` and
`--off-heap-ram` options before staring a query server based on a
desired *total* RAM amount.

## Primary options

#### `--format=<fmt>`

Select output format. Choices include:

`lines` *(default)*: Print command-line arguments on one line each.

`json`: Print them as a JSON array.

### Options from the invoking command's command line

#### `-M, --ram=<MB>`

Set total amount of RAM the query evaluator should be allowed to use.

### Common options

#### `-h, --help`

Show this help text.

#### `-J=<opt>`

\[Advanced] Give option to the JVM running the command.

(Beware that options containing spaces will not be handled correctly.)

#### `-v, --verbose`

Incrementally increase the number of progress messages printed.

#### `-q, --quiet`

Incrementally decrease the number of progress messages printed.

#### `--verbosity=<level>`

\[Advanced] Explicitly set the verbosity level to one of errors,
warnings, progress, progress+, progress++, progress+++. Overrides `-v`
and `-q`.

#### `--logdir=<dir>`

\[Advanced] Write detailed logs to one or more files in the given
directory, with generated names that include timestamps and the name of
the running subcommand.

(To write a log file with a name you have full control over, instead
give `--log-to-stderr` and redirect stderr as desired.)
