{% data reusables.pre-release-program.expiring-user-access-tokens %}

When your GitHub App acts on behalf of a user, it performs user-to-server requests. These requests must be authorized with a user's access token. User-to-server requests include requesting data for a user, like determining which repositories to display to a particular user. These requests also include actions triggered by a user, like running a build.

{% data reusables.apps.expiring_user_authorization_tokens %}

## Identifying users on your site

To authorize users for standard apps that run in the browser, use the [web application flow](#web-application-flow).

To authorize users for headless apps without direct access to the browser, such as CLI tools or Git credential managers, use the [device flow](#device-flow). The device flow uses the OAuth 2.0 [Device Authorization Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628).

## Web application flow

Using the web application flow, the process to identify users on your site is:

1. Users are redirected to request their GitHub identity
2. Users are redirected back to your site by GitHub
3. Your GitHub App accesses the API with the user's access token

If you select **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** when creating or modifying your app, step 1 will be completed during app installation. For more information, see "[Authorizing users during installation](/apps/installing-github-apps/#authorizing-users-during-installation)."

### 1. Request a user's GitHub identity
Direct the user to the following URL in their browser:

    GET {% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/oauth/authorize

When your GitHub App specifies a `login` parameter, it prompts users with a specific account they can use for signing in and authorizing your app.

#### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`client_id` | `string` | **Required.** The client ID for your GitHub App. You can find this in your [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) when you select your app. **Note:** The app ID and client ID are not the same, and are not interchangeable.
`redirect_uri` | `string` | The URL in your application where users will be sent after authorization. This must be an exact match to {% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %} one of the URLs you provided as a **Callback URL** {% else %} the URL you provided in the **User authorization callback URL** field{% endif %} when setting up your GitHub App and can't contain any additional parameters.
`state` | `string` | This should contain a random string to protect against forgery attacks and could contain any other arbitrary data.
`login` | `string` | Suggests a specific account to use for signing in and authorizing the app.
`allow_signup` | `string` | Whether or not unauthenticated users will be offered an option to sign up for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} during the OAuth flow. The default is `true`. Use `false` when a policy prohibits signups.

{% note %}

**Note:** You don't need to provide scopes in your authorization request. Unlike traditional OAuth, the authorization token is limited to the permissions associated with your GitHub App and those of the user.

{% endnote %}

### 2. Users are redirected back to your site by GitHub

If the user accepts your request, GitHub redirects back to your site with a temporary `code` in a code parameter as well as the state you provided in the previous step in a `state` parameter. If the states don't match, the request was created by a third party and the process should be aborted.

{% note %}

**Note:** If you select **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** when creating or modifying your app, GitHub returns a temporary `code` that you will need to exchange for an access token. The `state` parameter is not returned when GitHub initiates the OAuth flow during app installation.

{% endnote %}

Exchange this `code` for an access token.  When expiring tokens are enabled, the access token expires in 8 hours and the refresh token expires in 6 months. Every time you refresh the token, you get a new refresh token. For more information, see "[Refreshing user-to-server access tokens](/developers/apps/refreshing-user-to-server-access-tokens)."

Expiring user tokens are currently an optional feature and subject to change. To opt-in to the user-to-server token expiration feature, see "[Activating optional features for apps](/developers/apps/activating-optional-features-for-apps)."

Make a request to the following endpoint to receive an access token:

    POST {% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/oauth/access_token

#### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`client_id` | `string` | **Required.** The  client ID for your GitHub App.
`client_secret` | `string`   | **Required.** The  client secret for your GitHub App.
`code` | `string`   | **Required.** The code you received as a response to Step 1.
`redirect_uri` | `string` | The URL in your application where users will be sent after authorization. This must be an exact match to {% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %} one of the URLs you provided as a **Callback URL** {% else %} the URL you provided in the **User authorization callback URL** field{% endif %} when setting up your GitHub App and can't contain any additional parameters.
`state` | `string` | The unguessable random string you provided in Step 1.

#### Response

By default, the response takes the following form. The response parameters `expires_in`, `refresh_token`,  and `refresh_token_expires_in` are only returned when you enable expiring user-to-server access tokens.

```json
{
  "access_token": "ghu_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a",
  "expires_in": 28800,
  "refresh_token": "ghr_1B4a2e77838347a7E420ce178F2E7c6912E169246c34E1ccbF66C46812d16D5B1A9Dc86A1498",
  "refresh_token_expires_in": 15811200,
  "scope": "",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

### 3. Your GitHub App accesses the API with the user's access token

The user's access token allows the GitHub App to make requests to the API on behalf of a user.

    Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN
    GET {% data variables.product.api_url_code %}/user

For example, in curl you can set the Authorization header like this:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" {% data variables.product.api_url_pre %}/user
```

## Device flow

{% note %}

**Note:** The device flow is in public beta and subject to change.

{% endnote %}

The device flow allows you to authorize users for a headless app, such as a CLI tool or Git credential manager.

{% ifversion device-flow-is-opt-in %}Before you can use the device flow to identify and authorize users, you must first enable it in your app's settings. For more information on enabling device flow, see "[Modifying a GitHub App](/developers/apps/managing-github-apps/modifying-a-github-app)." {% endif %}For more information about authorizing users using the device flow, see "[Authorizing OAuth Apps](/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow)."

## Check which installation's resources a user can access

Once you have an OAuth token for a user, you can check which installations that user can access.

    Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN
    GET /user/installations

You can also check which repositories are accessible to a user for an installation.

    Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN
    GET /user/installations/:installation_id/repositories

More details can be found in: [List app installations accessible to the user access token](/rest/apps#list-app-installations-accessible-to-the-user-access-token) and [List repositories accessible to the user access token](/rest/apps#list-repositories-accessible-to-the-user-access-token).

## Handling a revoked GitHub App authorization

If a user revokes their authorization of a GitHub App, the app will receive the [`github_app_authorization`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#github_app_authorization) webhook by default. GitHub Apps cannot unsubscribe from this event. {% data reusables.webhooks.authorization_event %}

## User-level permissions

You can add user-level permissions to your GitHub App to access user resources, such as user emails, that are granted by individual users as part of the [user authorization flow](#identifying-users-on-your-site). User-level permissions differ from [repository and organization-level permissions](/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps), which are granted at the time of installation on an organization or personal account.

You can select user-level permissions from within your GitHub App's settings in the **User permissions** section of the **Permissions & webhooks** page. For more information on selecting permissions, see "[Editing a GitHub App's permissions](/apps/managing-github-apps/editing-a-github-app-s-permissions/)."

When a user installs your app on their account, the installation prompt will list the user-level permissions your app is requesting and explain that the app can ask individual users for these permissions.

Because user-level permissions are granted on an individual user basis, you can add them to your existing app without prompting users to upgrade. You will, however, need to send existing users through the user authorization flow to authorize the new permission and get a new user-to-server token for these requests.

## User-to-server requests

While most of your API interaction should occur using your server-to-server installation access tokens, certain endpoints allow you to perform actions via the API using a user access token. Your app can make the following requests using [GraphQL](/graphql) or [REST](/rest) endpoints.
